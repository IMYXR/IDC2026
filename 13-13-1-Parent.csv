So we're going to start off by asking you what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? What parts of these stories stood out to you? I mean the part that I like is I think it opens opportunity to experience things that are maybe far away or in different time periods that in a way that you...
00:18:00
"can't do just reading a book. So it gives that opportunity to have a more enriched experience. So I think that's probably the positive part of it. Is there other positive ways that children can use VR? I mean the academic, I mean it's the experience with the academic and learning part of it. The distraction part I think is a double-edged sword, right? Because in some ways it can be positive. I mean if you can do, like I watched a doctor with the medical procedures."
00:47:00
"with that distraction without less than maybe to avoid sedation or different things like that. That can be a positive if he's using it as a distraction. If the two stories, the second one was more of a negative way, then it can go too far. So it's finding the balance between the two to provide that enrichment without it retracting from the reality of life."
01:12:00
"So what kind of problems or issues might VR create for children and families along these lines? I think it's like any electronics, or is that dependency, or wanting to do it all the time, or you know..."
01:26:00
"doing a VR instead of hands-on because there's still, especially as children, that hands-on learning, that tactile is still, in my opinion, so important for brain development and things like that where virtually they might get the experience but it's not the same as that kind of tactile experience of doing something. We were actually talking about this at home the other day, like playing a board game by hand versus playing a board game on a video game."
01:53:00
"We like sports, like playing we, whatever, sport versus doing it in real life is very different physically, you know. And actually my daughter was like, you know, trying to play a sport in real life, she's like, wow, this is so much harder than, you know, the we version of this or what have you or, you know, VR breathing. So you think you're getting the experience, but it's still not the same as that real life tactical thing. You know, so to replace the real life tactical, I think is..."
02:20:00
"Also a slippery slope could be a dangerous, I don't know if dangerous is the right way, but a negative situation potentially. Are there other problems or concerns that you might?"
02:33:00
"I'm sure it affects any electronic brain development, especially in kids and things like that, or it changes the neural path and things. How much that's been, how does VR compare to, I'll use Aircourse, normal electronic use versus limited screen time, that whole spectrum. So how does that play into that whole concept, especially in kids, of that neurodevelopment and how that might affect long term and different things on brain."
03:02:00
"So who do you think should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Are you talking like parent versus teacher versus more just general open question? Who should decide, yeah. I mean I think obviously the parent plays a key role in that. You know, it probably depends on the situation. I mean the child and self-autonomy to a certain extent. Obviously if there's interest or not. But I think it's the..."
03:32:00
"providing proper guide rails within that. You know, so I think with anything, that's a combined deal. Can you give examples of who would provide these guidelines? Well, whether it's a parent or a teacher, or it depends on the setting that it's being used in, right? You know, if it's being used at school, obviously that parent is giving that."
03:55:00
"delegated control if you will, or to a teacher in theory or something like that. But I think kids aren't always good about putting limits on themselves, so it's finding and using it in proper ways and making sense and finding the right balance to that. So there's various authority figures in those situations, especially when it pertains to childhood use."
04:23:00
"When creators design VR for children and or for families, what important things they should keep in mind? When they create the experiences? Yeah, when they design VR experiences for children. I'm not sure. That's an interesting question. I'll say it again. When creators or developers design VR experiences for kids. I was just thinking like how to, you know, there's..."
04:52:00
It's probably that balance between the entertainment aspect versus maybe the academic or educational aspect of it. How much of it seeps in reality versus how much is a true fantasy type virtual situation. I think the be careful part is...
05:12:00
"not being clear of one versus the other, right? So you're having fantasy or maybe false things is okay, that, you know, but if it's being couched in, you know, where a child maybe can't separate or making sure this is a factual history thing versus this is a made-up thing and not, you know, creating confusion at that point, you know, where it might create false understanding of reality or history or things like that."
05:39:00
Can you maybe provide specific considerations or example? If you can think of any.
05:47:00
"I mean, like I said, it's... I guess the example I had is like in my mind, like there's a more fictional story or a fantasy thing that, you know, portrayed as maybe something that really happened, you know, as factual history or thing, you know, that creates that false narrative, you know, or, you know, influencing of a particular belief or things like that, that..."
06:14:00
"So you're worried about the content of these experiences? Yes. OK. Any other considerations besides the content? I mean, from a physical aspect, I guess I don't know what studies have been done in terms of impact to vision, or like we talked earlier about the neuro, neurodevelopment, things like that. Is there any visual? If you use it too much, how does it affect your vision in terms of neurofarge? Things like that might be something to consider as well. What? You know, what? What?"
06:43:00
"long-term effects are not being considered with the use of it, especially if it increases."
06:52:00
"Yeah, no, thank you. I appreciate that. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about VR? I don't think so. That's good. Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much."
