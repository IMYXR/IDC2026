"are recording and have some questions? Okay, so what did you think about the use of VR in the stories?"
Speaker 1  0:07
"I thought it was a great way to supplement or kind of a for the, for the school situation to supplement education and take the students places where they otherwise wouldn't be able to go and have those experiences. And for the health care scenarios, I, I thought they were both good. You saw that, frankly, stuck in the hospital you want them to be? And last. Yeah. And then, and then, of course, when it was kind of easing trials, discomfort with, with the kind of machinery that they were using imaging machinery, and I thought that was a very good news."
Qiao Jin  0:56
"Okay, so what kinds of issues or problems that VR might create?"
Speaker 1  1:01
"What kind of problems? Yeah. I think isolation is my biggest concern about it. And it's kind of for me, I see the same issue with, with video games and being in like a virtual world, whether you're in with a headset or not. So I think that's my biggest concern with that for kids. Yep. And adults."
Qiao Jin  1:28
"It's would be more useful if like, people kind of joined together, you stand off our individual journey. Yeah,"
Speaker 1  1:34
"I think if, for example, with the school scenarios where where you were, physically, it wasn't your entire day, it was a directed kind of enhancement to your education. So I, where you're still getting together with other people, you're still having social interactions in real life, versus only seeing a VR"
Qiao Jin  2:07
crucial excursions? Right. Okay. So this one would be a hard question. Okay. We should decide which we are experiencing. Okay.
Speaker 1  2:20
Interesting question. I think parents need to be aware of VR experiences that our children are being introduced to. I think there's probably a level of
Qiao Jin  2:40
I don't know. I don't know. Like the educators.
Speaker 1  2:44
"Yeah. Right. Yeah. Some level of of expert, you know, guidelines and recommendations on us"
Qiao Jin  2:54
about the recommended age to use
Speaker 1  2:57
"VR. Yeah, sure. Or how, you know, recommendations on how much like time wise people Oh, yeah. I just, I My biggest concern with it, is your kid basically living isolated in physical reality, but so"
Qiao Jin  3:17
"he thinks he or she would have a high doubt maybe like in the physical world to protect them or more towards protecting? Sure. Both of them. Okay, so the next question, when creators design VR for kids, do you think there is something important for them to keep in mind?"
Speaker 1  3:39
"What do I think are, um, things that are important for them to keep in mind? Yeah, goes this way? Because I think, in particular, if they're designing for children, they should be aware that children don't have good decision making. And they"
Speaker 1  4:02
"Yeah, I don't know. They're just they need to, they need to be aware of kind of the authority or the power that they would basically be having over a"
Qiao Jin  4:12
"venue to persevere to keep please a parent. The children as per people the average, right, right. Yeah, I think so. Is there anything else you want to tell me about the app for children?"
Speaker 1  4:27
"No, I don't think so. I know it's, it's an exciting time opens up a lot of really exciting possibilities. And I think it can do a lot of a lot of good for a lot of people. But as a parent, I'm still kind of wary of how much kids with these and in what capacity and what level of supervision"
Qiao Jin  4:49
so what do you mean the credibility?
Speaker 1  4:54
"I mean, it's I Think mainly the maybe it's more the level of supervision that you can have over what your child is viewing or doing or how they're interacting yeah"
Qiao Jin  5:14
that makes sense okay that's it thank you so much
