"Great, so what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? And if there's any parts that stood out to you? I mean all of them I think were portrayed very positively, with the exception of I believe when the mother, when she was done making dinner, she said she had to call out to her son and her father a few times to get them. Other than that I think they portrayed a lot of the positive benefits that VR can bring"

"Can you describe how they can be used in positive ways? Oh, sure. One for distractions, for getting kiddos to lay still during several imaging or different therapeutic interventions. Another one is to get them to participate in those interventions. So from a rehabilitation standpoint, it would be very positive. And then the other very positive one is being able to see and interact with family and friends that are a long distance away. So what?"
00:55:00
"What kinds of problems might VR create for your child or just for children in general? Disassociation with the real life. You can really get distractions, I guess, just in general. That's a good word, disassociation. Distractions, okay. Is there other problems that might... I guess nothing really popped into my mind compared to those ones. Okay, what are some of the situations which VR should not be used?"
01:25:00
Like just some blankets.
01:30:00
"I guess I don't have any particular ones. As long as it falls within the regular ground rules of the laws of society, I don't think that it needs to stay out of any certain areas. I'm sure that each area you can find a niche way that it can be used. Okay. Who do you think should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children?"
01:52:00
"I think that's a much bigger question than just VR. I think that as society we've put certain guidelines and regulations in place from the, I don't know, family level, community level, state level, federal level, I assume all of them will have some bearing of some, I think some laws and regulations around VR. Are you expecting them to basically provide an input to support you as a parent? I would imagine somebody will come up with statements, yes."

"So when creators design VR for kids and families, what important things they should keep in mind?"
02:35:00
"So when designers or creators, developers of VR, experiences for kids, what important things they should keep in mind when creating these experiences for kids? Safety. Safety, okay. And then what do you mean by safety? Can you impact that? Like physical, mental, emotional? Sure, physical, mental, emotional, all of them. You can have scary things, there can be very... Oh, the content you mean? ..slippery things. Okay. The ways that you interact with things as well could be..."
03:07:00
"Other stuff, any considerations besides safety? I've been having it in my mind at the moment. At the moment, safety, okay. Is there anything else that you want to tell us about the VR experiences for kids that you thought of through the whole study but you didn't get the chance to talk about or we didn't ask about? I mean, I don't think there... I think that the same principles and stuff that are around any video games apply themselves to VR in the same field as me. You don't think VR would be different? No, I don't."
03:37:00
"Um, kind of. Okay, awesome. Well, this has been great. Thank you for your help. I'm gonna stop there. So I guess as a parent interacting with kiddos that have a VR set, the challenging things that I see are..."
03:53:00
"You can't see what they see, so being able to select certain menu items that we're happy to go into certain games, that's challenging, as well as just making sure that it fits correctly, so that the eyes line up correctly and you can see the perspectives correctly. And then running into walls and stuff. Thanks."
