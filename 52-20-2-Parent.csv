"So what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of these stories stood out to you in both the at home and education? So at home I felt it was a great way for people who lived across long distances to interact in a much more interactive way. Like Zoom can only do so much but I feel like in that regard, you know, you could do games like they said, like they showed, you could do..."
00:24:00
"You can just interact as a family more as opposed to just talking one on one like that. In terms of the app school, I thought the field trip was great. I thought that's a great way to use it and I can kind of control the setting. I thought like in the classroom might be a little bit more difficult based on a couple of things."
00:46:00
"Just disconnection issues, there's a whole bunch of equity issues surrounding kids who might not have access to the internet at home, or might not have the ability to connect in that way, might not have a house that would be supportive of that kind of interaction. So in that regard I thought I was a little less, but overall I'm very much pro-technology so I think any way that we can..."
01:10:00
"bring more people into systems like that, it's better. So yeah. So how can we, you know, how can we, how can children and family use VR in positive or helpful ways? Sure, so I think, I think in terms of school, if we can provide places and schools."
01:29:00
"both in schools, like for kids who aren't safe at home or don't have homes that necessarily are safe, to allow them to participate like in a school setting, still use VR, but in a place where they feel safer. I think that's probably great. I think like, you know, this, that's the kind of thing the Smithsonian's are great. I've been there many times, but not everyone gets access to it. So I think in that regard, it's great. Like it allows people to see things they've never been able to see. It allows people to stand on the Serengeti, to stand on the space station."
01:59:00
"And at home, yeah, I think that was a great use of, either one was a great use. I thought, you know, my son plays Minecraft, he uses Roblox, he does those things, I don't have a problem with that. And so I think his ability to actually be a little bit more immersed for me actually would be a better way for him to."
02:19:00
"participating as opposed to just staring at a screen. So I think in that regard, I actually appreciate it much more than just staring at a computer screen for a couple hours. So what kind of problems might be our creative children or children's families in general? Yeah, I mean, I think like I said, just I think there's a lot of access issues. I think, you know, especially in the cities, it wouldn't be a problem. But I think of like role."
02:42:00
"rural areas, internet, fiber wire isn't very strong, so there's issues there with people being able to actually connect, get onto a network. And then there's issues with, you know, like kids feeling, a lot of kids go to school and that's their one safe place for their day. And so I think there are issues surrounding."
03:01:00
"you know, that's an unfortunate reality, but there are issues there that we have to look at as well. So... You mean isolation? Not isolation, but just kids who are in homes that aren't safe. The parents might be violent or dangerous or not. Not people who are necessarily like what we would classify as great parents. And so I think, you know, they go to school and that's their one safe place. And so them not being able to go to school is... could be a problem. So, yeah. Perfect."
03:28:00
Anything else that you can foresee that could create problems for kids?
03:35:00
"I mean, there are issues with screen time. I don't know how it relates to screen time. I don't know what the research suggests about kids, how much time they spend staring at a VR system, if it correlates to the issues that might surround screen time and kids staring at screens for hours and hours and hours. Can you just speak a little bit more about these issues? Sure. I mean, there's research to suggest that kids who use screens for more than two hours a day or something tend to have decreasing ability to focus, ability to do things like read."
04:05:00
"and that kind of stuff so I would wonder what the research suggests about kids who use VR for extended periods of time. So that could be a concern for you? That would be a concern. I mean I just want to see the research and I think I'm not like a conspiracy theorist so as long as the research was positive I don't have a problem with it. Okay, well I mean we don't know. Yeah right, yeah totally."
04:29:00
What other issue? What other? What some other situation? If there is any situation which VR should not be used. Should not be used? Oh I see. I mean I have huge issues around VR and like drone usage. Like police who use drones and they use VR in drones. I have huge issues surrounding there. I think...
04:50:00
"But I mean, I think other than issues like that, extreme issues like that, I think it's a great, it seemed like a great technology. It was amazing, it was really cool. I've never, I've done it once or twice before, but not in that regard where it was like, so, you're so in there. So I think it's great. I don't think there are many issues where I have an issue with it. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children, or good choices for children? Oh, that's a, I think, I mean, I think overall it should be the parents."
05:18:00
"But I do think that we have educational institutions that we trust to educate our children and involve our children. So the hard question to answer, I think it should be combined state and like the state or the education system and then parents should obviously, parents always have the final say but I think overall I would trust an educational system to have the best outlook for our kids and I would trust what they've got in regards to it."
05:47:00
"Yeah, guidance would be, yeah, state or educational or scientific guidance in terms of like what is and isn't good, I think is always helpful. So, last question. When creators design VR for kids and families, what important things they should keep in mind? Uh, I think..."
06:07:00
"overall ease of access and ease of use. I think kids, although my kids are way more technology advanced than I am, but I do think just being easy to use, I'd hope a portion of it would be educational and just being"
06:29:00
"I think also ease of use for parents to learn how to use it. So I think that's super important as well. That's great. Is there anything else that you thought of, want to tell us about VR for families and kids that you didn't get the chance to say? No, I don't think so. That's it? Okay, awesome. Thank you so much. Yeah, of course, yeah. It's really wonderful. It's awesome, thank you."
