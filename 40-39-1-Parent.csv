"I thought it was very interesting, because I don't really use of VR to kind of take you out of reality, if you're experiencing lots of pain and stop. I've done that personally, where I've played video games, you know, not as immersive as VR, but kind of get my mind off, you know, like, different ailments have had over the time. So I could see VR just even taking you a little bit further away from any pain or anguish. I also think that just occupying the time for like a child, when they're in, like us getting a scan or an x ray or something like that, they can just like watch a cartoon, I think that'd be very beneficial. I can see that being a positive thing, versus a negative, like scary experience for the child. And like at all, in whole life, I can just see a kind of it could possibly bring like family members that were in remote locations, like in that scenario, closer together just for a little bit, I could see that being also like something worthwhile, like, some good time and money. And"
Researcher  7:38
"so yeah, that makes sense. So I know you already mentioned some of this, but are there any other issues or problems might be created for your child?"
Speaker 3  7:47
"I think the only negative that I can see would be an isolation issue where they're just kind of like her to cut off for a long period of time, maybe from actual reality. So they have really bad illness. And they're just have the VR set up for 24 hours a day. I think that would be negative. So yeah, it's kind of like a big luck. Too far extreme. That would be a negative."
Researcher  8:13
Like we have a better motion tracking technique.
Speaker 3  8:17
"That wouldn't be cool, though. I couldn't be behind that I couldn't be behind."
Researcher  8:21
So that's fine. I produced.
Speaker 3  8:23
Great. Yeah. I could see that. I could see that being more of a long term sort of solution. Yeah.
Researcher  8:31
"Okay, so next question shouldn't be like very broad one. So who should decide VR experiences are suitable for kids?"
Speaker 3  8:39
Who's Who should? Who should tell you what VR is good or bad? Is
Researcher  8:42
"that Yeah, right."
Unknown Speaker  8:44
"I guess the user, right? Yeah."
Researcher  8:46
"So I think it's, I think if you have to have some person to design guidelines, or like, maybe maybe the ethical suggestions for children to you"
Speaker 3  8:56
"know, I'm usually a big not a fan of like government or other agencies getting involved in that. So I think it'd be up to the parents or the individual person, if they're considered a minor or whatever, you know, the laws would stipulate."
Researcher  9:09
"Would you allow your child to use VR, individually or like using parents should be with their child?"
Speaker 3  9:15
"That's an interesting question. I think, if they're of a certain age or traceability, I don't, I could see out no problem. Like, I'll just throw a number like 12 or 30. You know what I mean? Like, they know like, the difference between reality and maybe not reality and, and then it's like, I think it's fine at that point they can distinguish."
Researcher  9:39
"So when create or design we are for kids and families, what important things to keep in mind."
Speaker 3  9:47
"Oh, boy, I don't know. I don't really think anything. I think it's such a broad appeal. You could do education, you could do video games, movies, you know, I just, I don't really know I have an answer for that."
Researcher  10:01
Yeah. Do you have any suggestions for the people who design the application or design the hardware? I know like the Coronavirus to highway two.
Speaker 3  10:09
"Oh, so like physical things? Yeah. I don't know. I like to you think that we're like, basically it's like instead of VR, AR where it just kind of comes together? Yeah. So I can see that going that way, though. I would like to. That would be cool. I'd love to see that. Do that. And that's your that's your you need to work on at the URL, right?"
Researcher  10:36
"Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So for the content site, we are content to have a discussion."
Unknown Speaker  10:45
"I really, do. You know what I mean, I think"
Researcher  10:48
"it just like too broad, like any application,"
Speaker 3  10:51
"I can see, you know, I'm a huge gamer, video games, most of my lessons, I was hurried. So it's only brought positive interactions and memories and fun and good hand eye coordination. And you're bored, and you play a game, you know what I mean? So I think it's all great. I think just whatever people decide, it's fun. And then the people that buy the software is just kind of the feedback that they'll get. So what I say doesn't really matter. It's just like, what other people throw their money at, you know what I mean? So that's very nice. Yeah, I don't really think there should be any limitations, really. So yeah,"
Researcher  11:28
"that's great. So the final question, I also want to tell us about using VR for kids."
Speaker 3  11:34
"Oh, boy, I think it's just such right now as we know, it's such a high threshold to get into but you know, when the headsets are getting smaller and lighter, cheaper, but i She's never even seen a headset before you're in so"
Researcher  11:52
they're not only not as normal as ours.
Speaker 3  11:55
"So I think we just need to get maybe more a demo or a kiosk or stuff out there. And be honest remember I said I was a gamer my whole life and since I was worried, I only did my first VR maybe a few months ago was the first time I ever want it was nobody really has nice ones at their house that I know of and stuff themselves. So we just need more cheaper an entry level maybe at first to get out there to try it and then if you'd like it and then okay, we have an add in are we got a nicer headset, are you"
Researcher  12:27
"Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, thank you so much."
