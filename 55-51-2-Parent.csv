"I'm going to start by asking you what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? You looked at home and education context. What parts of these stories stood out to you? I think the educational part for a little bit, not the whole day because they're losing personal interaction with other people. So I liked it to be used a little bit. Same with home."
00:25:00
"I liked it a little bit, not the whole evening and then they get together for dinner. There's no interaction there. How do you understand why you have that perspective? Tell me more. Because it's just you're in your own little world doing your own thing. Like when the families couldn't see the grandparents, I liked that because that was an opportunity. You couldn't actually physically be there with those people. So that I liked. So just the disengaged with each other."
00:54:00
"I didn't like that. Okay, so the disconnection. The disconnection with your family members when you're in the home. Was problematic for you? Yes. How can children and family use VR in beneficial or positive ways? Like when with the grandparents, they were able to interact with their grandparents and see them, even though they weren't physically there. And then in the school environment, you actually can, I think,"
01:21:00
"If you're a visual person, you're going to learn a lot more because with this you can see a lot more versus just the books. It's like a bigger picture and I think it just sticks in your memory a little better. What kinds of problems might VR create for kids or for children, families in general? The disconnect. They might isolate themselves and they don't develop the..."
01:48:00
"Communication skills with people. Communication, social skills, okay. What other problems that you can think of? I can't think of, I don't know. What else there would be with it? Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Meaning parents or the..."
02:08:00
education system or I don't know I think parents should okay yeah like you know I guess my question is like you should decide that VR experiences are a good choice for kids or not you said parents parents anybody else the school board I guess school boards okay is there some situation which we are should not be used
02:43:00
"I can't say that it shouldn't be used at all. I don't agree with that. I can't think of a specific what it shouldn't be. I don't know because it seems like a benefit to use it. Some context, yeah. So I don't know, I'm sorry. I can't really think of it. So I think the question is when creators or developers or designers or VR experiences for kids and families,"
03:08:00
"what important things they should keep in mind, or what considerations that they need to consider."
03:17:00
to kind of minimize the problems or risks.
03:27:00
"I don't know what the risks with this are to use it, so to think of what they should be thinking when they're creating these. I don't know, maybe time limits on things. Time limits, okay. If anything."
03:43:00
"Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about the VR but we didn't get the chance or didn't ask about or talk about? I think it's really cool. It's a really neat experience to be able to see that, that you can interact with and that with. I didn't know that like you could do that like they did with, but were they actually with the grandparents? Could they actually see them or they're just kind of there? Like we were, we saw a robot. Yeah, a robot, yeah. Oh, okay."
04:11:00
"It'd be cool if you could actually see the people instead of a robot. Oh, okay, so that's a consideration. How can we make it a little bit more realistic? If you could actually see the other person, that would be fun. And actually interact and touch it. Actually there, yeah, versus a robot image. Yeah, so that's a consideration that people... Yeah, I guess, yeah. Yeah, okay. Anything else that you're... Yeah, this is kind of new, right? Yes, it is. It's very new. Thank you so much. Oh, you're welcome."
