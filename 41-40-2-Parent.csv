Now we want to give you a chance to talk about about VR. So you have to the education area and the family area. So what did you think about the use of VR in these stories?
Speaker 3  6:29
"Yeah, for the first one with the school one I liked that the kids would be able to like go visit a place outside of the school without having to leave. So it's like they could visit other places around the world or something and feel like they get more of an immersive experience. Which is good as compared to trying to read something from a book and understand it. I didn't like the idea of only doing a virtual school setup just because like we're there in their bedroom, virtually joining school, I felt like they wouldn't get that social interaction as well. Like it's face to face time does. And then for the at home ones I like the idea of again, being able to like connect with people that like are across the country in the world that you can't just quickly walk down the street scene. Because then you can connect with them better. But then I the second video, I didn't like how they talked about. The mom wasn't able to get their attention to come down for dinner. And they all were like separated in their own areas and like not interacting with each other. Yes. Yeah, I didn't like that as well."
Researcher  7:32
"Yeah, you already mentioned. But are there any issues or problems? Like other issues?"
Speaker 3  7:40
"Other than interaction, I feel like it could make people kind of lazy is the right word. Just like if they feel like they're experiencing things without having to stand up and walk and everything. I could see potential health issues with that."
Researcher  7:52
"Yeah. Okay, so next one would be, like, kind of precious. Yeah, the who should decide which VR is suitble for children."
Speaker 3  8:01
"For children. I think the parents should decide it. And like they can maybe if a school has those VR things that give approval or disapproval on how it's used in the classrooms, all schools are also involved in this process. The educators, they would like me think what am I trying to say? They wouldn't have that option for the kids, but then the parents decide if the kids are allowed to do"
Researcher  8:22
"Oh, yeah. Are there any other stakeholders you can think of?"
Speaker 3  8:30
"I mean, I feel like once kids are old enough, like they're like 1617 and they're old enough to make those they can make the decisions for themselves but"
Researcher  8:39
"for younger ones, they still need the parents. Yes. Okay, so what creators so when did when creator design VR for kids and families what important things should they keep in mind? Do you have any suggestions for those were makers?"
Speaker 3  8:56
"maybe make things that's I don't know. Maybe have like time limits on them or something or like the screen time? Yeah, screen time. Exactly. And then maybe make some more like they're walking actually like on a treadmill or something."
Researcher  9:09
Or tracking technology?
Speaker 3  9:11
Yeah. So then they're actually moving on not just sitting still all the time.
Researcher  9:16
Nice. The final Is there anything else you want to tell me about the Apple Watch?
Unknown Speaker  9:21
I thought it was really cool. I've never done it before.
Researcher  9:25
Why on your was your takeaway I hope like Apple query sound like new device to make it easier to
"Yeah, yeah, it's kind of big but no, but I think that's cool."
