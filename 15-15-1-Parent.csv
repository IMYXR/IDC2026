"So if you could please tell us what did you think about the use of VR in these stories in both the context that you watched and what parts of these stories stood out to you? What parts of these stories what? Stood out to you. Oh I mean I think, I mean I gotta be honest I think it seems like one of those things that seems really cool in theory but sucks in reality. Like I don't think, I don't think a classroom full of kids is gonna sit with a bunch of stuff on their face."
00:29:00
"explore anything. I think it's, it ain't gonna do nothing. Like, I don't buy it. Like, just even, even the little thing, I mean, everyone's gonna be trying to shoot the thing and mess with it and constantly, like, I just don't see that working at all. And doing it all at home, like, that's your actual school. I think that would be just, you know, I just don't think, again, I just don't think it would work. I don't, I mean, if you're living in a rural area by yourself, and there's literally no other kids around, maybe."
00:57:00
"But I just have a hard time seeing how it would kind of bridge the gap between, in theory, what it would be and in the reality of having everything on your face and in your hands correctly and having the internet working correctly so that works and then having it be actually engaging enough. I think that's kind of one of the big things. Even when we were doing the little exploration thing, it's like..."
01:22:00
"Yeah, it's kind of cool, but we spend half the time trying to figure out how to move the rooms, and then you kind of go through the rooms and it's, you can't move or anything, you're just sitting there watching essentially a video playing of some guy floating around. I mean, it's cool in a way, but I don't want to spend another hour sitting there watching that, you know? So, as much as I think it's kind of cool, I just, I just don't think it would work in school. The only thing even with the family part that I thought would be kind of fun would be like,"
01:50:00
"People live in other areas. We've got family across the country that, in theory, we would do that. And I think it would be fun. But in reality?"
02:01:00
"I don't think everyone's actually gonna wanna sit down and put stuff on their face and click around. Can you tell me more about this? Cause you've kept mentioning it, in reality wouldn't work. Can you tell me why it wouldn't work a little bit more? I just don't think anyone would want to. I don't think a bunch of teenagers, I mean I got an 11 year old and a 14 year old, I mean are they gonna wanna go put on their VR headsets to go talk to their grandma? No. You know what I mean? Are they gonna wanna play Monopoly?"
02:26:00
"Again, it's kind of like a maybe for me. That was the only one that I kind of agreed, like maybe this could be good. But it's not the VR experience itself, it's sort of everything else that goes with that, with putting on the thing, putting your hands on, and then the idea that everyone's gonna pick it up the next day, no way, I can't see that happening in our family, just because everyone's always busy. I just, again, I think it's..."
02:52:00
"I think it's hard to get, we play games with our family and their grandparents and it's hard enough to get them to do it when we're all sitting there. I have a hard time thinking that putting on this stuff and doing it in virtual reality is like..."
03:06:00
going to be that much more. You mean like physical board games or you mean video games? Physical board games. Sam likes video games but we're not a big video game family across the board so that's something maybe people would want to do but again for us we're not a big video game family and we're not really like...
03:29:00
"people that have the newest and greatest technology all the time. And as much as I can imagine a scenario where it would be really fun and I feel like, yeah, that would be really cool, it's really hard for me to see, given the technology where it is, actually having it happen. You know, even the thing, that going back to school thing, I mean, yeah."
03:50:00
"In theory, it'd be really fun to be marching through something and seeing dinosaurs and all that kind of stuff, but in reality, you're not really marching anywhere. You're sitting in your chair, pushing buttons, and you can't control... And that's a concern for you? Well, it's less of a concern and more like I just don't think anyone would actually enjoy it. I mean, you can't interact. You're not really interacting with anything. It's just like playing a video game, which I mean, some kids really love, but I just don't see, like..."
04:17:00
"It's not like you can go up to a dinosaur and touch it or interact with it. It's just watching a video that happens to be plastered to your face in 360 as opposed to on a TV screen. Again, I kind of, in theory, think this stuff is cool, but at the same time, I'm like, what's about that? I just have a, having seen our kids do this kind of thing, I see them getting drowned in, but even the Roblox are the thing. Sam plays Roblox all the time."
04:46:00
"I don't know that putting it on his face and having him like... Maybe he would love it. Maybe he would really love it. But again, I'm concerned already that he plays Roblox with his friends all the time instead of seeing him in person. You know, sometimes they get together and play Roblox together and it's like, what are you guys doing? Why don't you go play? Play for real. Why are you concerned? What? Because they just sit there. I see. They just sit there and stare at a screen. They're not even interacting with each other. I mean, they're interacting on the video, but like..."
05:16:00
"This is something for me, I think the whole like we sort of encourage that during the pandemic because they couldn't actually see each other. But like for me sitting there and watching kids that are all like on their own iPads playing together. I'm just kind of like maybe you guys want to do something that doesn't involve sharing a screen because now you can all finally see each other again and you're just doing the same thing. You know, I said before that was supposed to be kind of like a backup plan. You guys can't see each other. At least you can have some interaction and some social time with your friends."
05:46:00
"through this online interface, that was really cool. But then that seems like that's replacing actual real life interface to a degree for some kids. And that's a little bit, you know. So how can children and family use VR in positive ways, or helpful ways? I mean, I think, I don't think like, again, I don't, I mean, maybe someone can figure it out. I mean, so maybe someone that has, is more digitally inclined, I guess, you know. But I mean, for me, it's like,"
06:15:00
"The issue isn't so much what's positive and negative, it's more like what's even enjoyable compared to whatever you can do without the headset on your face and the controllers in your hands. I don't personally see virtual reality at this point ever winning out for me over actually going and sitting and having dinner with someone. It's a nice little sort of replacement."
06:40:00
"So I mean, I don't know. I mean, again, to me, it's not even positive or negative. I mean, maybe some families, maybe some people really love it, and it's super awesome for them, and for them, good for them. But for me personally, I ain't judging whether that's positive or negative. I'm just more saying I just have a hard time seeing it. Being my preferred option, I guess, is kind of what I'm saying. Yeah. So kind of along these lines, if you there's"
07:06:00
"Besides the enjoyable part, is there any kinds of problems we are creating for kids and family? I mean for me, I think like, the big problem for me that I see even with like, you know, our kids always being on the video screens is like, like that's not, you know, I mean I guess for some people they say it is real life, but for me that's like, it's not real life. I mean if all your interactions are coming, are being sort of like, you know, moderated through a video screen, like..."
07:35:00
"How do you move through the world? Like you still have to walk down through a crowd of people. You still have to like, do you know how to actually act? You know what I mean? Or you know, I mean, I think like, I think you see a lot of like online interaction. You know, people take things more seriously than I think maybe they should sometimes. People say things maybe they wouldn't say. And once you say something online, there's a record of it. Right. Whereas in real life."
08:02:00
"Maybe you get in an argument with your friend and it's like you say some things you didn't want to say and you know, whatever, but you can get over it because it's in the past. If you do it all online, it's forever. It's not in the past, it's right now because it's right there. I see, that's a concern. Yeah, I think it's a concern because I think people are going to not be allowed to grow or they're going to be sort of trapped in whatever that sort of thing is if they said something negative about one another or that's going to be the only way they can interact with someone."
08:31:00
"I mean for me it's kind of like, that's my concern with my kids and their friends. It's like they spend so much time interacting with each other online. And you see that happen in person too, but it's like, what are you gonna do for real life? I mean, I guess there's some jobs where you can just be online all the time, but I don't think that's really how the world is gonna work. And maybe just because I'm old, but it's also one of those things where it's like,"
09:02:00
"You know, it's not positive or negative, but it's kind of the difference between playing like a video game, you know, sports or playing sports. I mean, like both are fun, you can do both, it's both a good time, but like, you know, they're different experiences and if all of your experiences are moderated through a video screen and through a bunch of technology, super nice if maybe you aren't able to get to certain places or do certain things or physically if you can't do certain things. But you know, if you can, you know."
09:31:00
actual lived experience I think I personally prefer again I'm a judging people that feel otherwise I mean I don't know I don't know what a positive or negative judgment it's not really that it's more kind of like you know I just I don't know okay so who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children I mean I would say their parents I guess you know I mean I think if there's something that's like legitimately dangerous
09:53:00
you know to people or they could find out hey you know this is really bad I mean I could see there being like legislation or something around that I wouldn't really have a problem with it but I think in general you know parents should be able to choose you know although there you know there are certainly parents who put their kids in positions where they're not necessarily safe so that's it that's a tough one as well it's just more there's a you know that's probably your best possible option but I don't think there's a perfect perfect for this head
10:16:00
When okay one last question when creators of Designing VR for families and kids what important things they should keep in mind. I Don't know. I mean maybe like some sort of way to like You know break the spell. I think you know I mean like remind people that this is online I mean like the example with people everyone's eating dinner. They're all ignoring each other like I think that's exactly what happened but like I also feel like
10:42:00
"the idea that it'll take a couple minutes and then they'll come down. That's not necessarily true either. I think there's people that would just stay on it forever if they could, if there were enough other people in there to interact. So I mean for me it's kind of like, I don't know the science behind it but I have to imagine it's probably not entirely healthy to be on it 10 hours a day. And yet there's certainly people that are on their phones 10 hours a day and if you can replace. So I mean that's what I would say is like."
11:08:00
"If there's some sort of way to remind people, hey, this is, you're in virtual reality right now, you still gotta go to the bathroom and eat, or you still gotta do this or that, that would be good. But it's hard for me to say, because I feel like if their job is to design immersive, enjoyable experiences that people wanna be a part of, well, right there, that's already gonna conflict with someone taking care of their body, taking care of themselves mentally, and understanding how to interact with people in real life. You know what I mean? Because I just think the internet tells us"
11:38:00
"Even good people, you know, they probably say things they don't want to say on internet or you know, you just kind of, I feel like there's, I feel like it's the possibility that there'll still be that sort of emotional heightened thing that happens with people, you know, when they're online, the same thing can happen with virtual reality and you can certainly see people sort of forgetting, you know, that."
12:00:00
"not everything is words on the screen or not everything is images flashing by like there's actual things that happen in the physical world, you know? Is there anything else that you want to tell us about VR that you didn't get the chance to talk about? No, I mean I think that says it. I mean again, I don't have, I don't think negatively about it. I just, I don't think it's a replacement for real life and I kind of feel like... You expressed your perspective and concerns, right? Exactly. For your family. That's what we want to hear. Yeah, I mean I'm not scared of it, but I'm also kind of like..."
12:31:00
"I don't think it would replace going to the museum. I don't think it would replace going to the museum in real life. Not everyone gets to go to the museum, so it's just better than nothing. Yeah, for sure. Probably. But again, it would be hard for me to see a classroom with 30 kids all doing it. You know what I mean? You're going to get some people that are just not going to be into it, and it's going to cause problems for everyone else. I don't know. Yeah, it makes sense. Thank you so much."
