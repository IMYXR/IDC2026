"And so yeah, we're just gonna record your answer so that we don't miss anything that you say. So very first question, what do you think about the use of VR in these stories? And what parts of these stories stood out to you?"
Child  0:12
"If so, I think it was mostly fine. Are you concerned about like, how much electronics time? So like in the second one at home, I thought it was better that they like, did it for an hour. So it's good that they're not on there the whole time. And you're not like living your life for that."
Speaker 0  0:33
"And, you know, like any, like, you noticed any of the benefits of VR? Like, how can children and families use VR in like, positive or helpful ways?"
Child  0:43
"It's nice to see your family remotely. I've got a big family. So we're scattered everywhere. I also thought it was smart that you get to like go places virtually. Like, oh, we don't have the budget for this field trip. But we have VR so so. ..."
Speaker 0  1:02
"Yes, yeah. And what kinds of problems might be are created for you as a kid? And can you give any specific examples?"
Child  1:10
"So obviously, I went through online school, that was a struggle. I think being there in real life would be a lot better than being able to just like log off and stuff. Like to help pay attention and stuff. And then at home, like, part of it safety."
So there's that and then kids can mess around with it.there's I don't know the name for it. But stuff.
Speaker 0  1:45
Yeah. So yeah. Okay. And who do you think should decide which VR experiences are a good choice for children?
Child  1:53
"I want to say the government, but I don't think I'm gonna say their parents are, you know, if you're an adult, you choose for yourself. Right. But like, if you disagree with their decisions, just don't use it. There's that? And then obviously, there needs to be some restrictions. But that's a different problem."
Speaker 0  2:25
"like, within, like your own use of like electronics that like you currently have, or there are adults in your life that like, kind of put wheels or like restrictions around like how long you can use it or anything like that,"
Child  2:35
"or Yeah, so once a week, my parents can look at my average screen time, okay. If it's like too high, they'll be like, Okay, we're gonna start setting timers for you until it gets down again, right? Yeah. So like, we had a problem with my brother who was spending like 10 hours a day on his phone. Yeah. So we had to do that. And then there are certain apps that I can add. So..."
Speaker 0  3:00
"yeah, that makes sense. And then when VR makers create VR experiences for children and families, what are some important things that they should keep in mind?"
Child  3:13
"Okay, so definitely being with somebody like in that world is important, because I was all freaked out because I thought they weren't going to be there. I was like, Oh, what if it's like a roller coaster? So that definitely, and then, like, again, making sure things are staying appropriate, unless you're like, going through a whole process."
Speaker 0  3:34
"Right, right. Um, and you have any, like, specific comments about like, the hardware of it, like wasn't comfortable for you? Like, do you think that there's something along those lines that like VR makers or experts should keep in mind?"
Child  3:49
Like the actual the actual headset? The controls were a little uncomfortable to get used to. And it was kind of itch on my eye. That was crowded.
Speaker 0  3:59
"And then, is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for family?"
Child  4:06
Not that I can think of.
