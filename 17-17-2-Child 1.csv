"Oh, okay, cool. So now that you've been able to experience VR yourself, and then also see it at home, and school, what did you think about VR in those stories? Did anything stand out to school?"
Unknown Speaker  0:20
"I think it would be a great way like say... you move to a different state. You have to take classes, you can use a virtual reality to take those classes."
Researcher  0:30
"Yeah, for sure. What do you think are some benefits of using virtual reality? Just like generally for students? Or for kids? Who think of any, no, no benefits? Can you think of any problems that could create?"
Unknown Speaker  0:49
They use it too long? They can get like eye visions issues?
Researcher  0:56
"Yeah, it's really good point. Um, is there like any other issues or bad things that could come with VR?"
Child  1:05
Kids because they're addicted and like.
Researcher  1:08
"yeah, I know for sure. Who do you think should decide which VR experiences are good?"
Child  1:18
"Parents and children,"
Researcher  1:20
"yeah. Like parents, children, teachers, or what do you think?"
Child  1:25
I will chose Parents.
Researcher  1:26
Yeah. Is there any reason you say that specifically? Because
Unknown Speaker  1:30
Cuz a parent will know what's appropriate and inappropriate for the kids.
Researcher  1:34
"Perfect. And then finally, when people listen to people who create these different VR experiences, when they're creating new ones, who should like like, what should they keep in mind? When they're creating these experiences? (don't know.)"
Like is there anything like was that like that from your own experience? Was the headset too heavy? Should they make it more inclusive for people with glasses or things like that? Anything like that?
Child  2:08
I would say....The back strap?
Researcher  2:17
Yeah. Is there any experience that you would want to see in VR?
Child  2:27
Minecraft.
Researcher  2:27
"That's been a popular answer. Is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for kids specifically? Okay, perfect. You did a great job."
