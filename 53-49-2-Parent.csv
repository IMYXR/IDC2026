"So what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of these stories stood out to you? I thought it was great, the interaction that you can't get just sitting at home, being able to get into different scenarios or going to visit places. But then also, I mean we just ended with COVID, so the fact that you can do virtual games or interactions with family members and stuff, it's a great connection for maybe people who are further apart."
00:27:00
"But the one part that stood out for me in a negative way though is the family that weren't listening, they weren't calling, so they were more engrossed in the virtual reality that was right in front of them versus the family interaction and that. So I could see how it could pull you out of reality and be more engrossed in the virtual. So it would definitely have to be a happy balance."
00:50:00
"So just to ask really quickly, you mentioned possible benefits. How can children and family use VR in positive or helpful ways, or beneficial ways, yeah? We can learn. I can't necessarily afford it."
01:04:00
"travel with my kids across all the continents, but we could jump on and we could go learn about it or they could take a trip to Paris without going to Paris kind of thing. Also interactions with distant family members or friends, being able to still do things with them other than just sitting and talking on the phone. That's cool, okay. What kind of problems or issues might be out created for your children?"
01:30:00
"I think similar to any other electronics, just that tunnel vision you get. Or they craving it and wanting it more and not maybe going outside to play."
01:42:00
"you know, we did growing up and stuff, you know, more of that obsession, you know, maybe not having that personal interaction too. Maybe they're friends rather than getting together and having a sleepover or something. They want to just get in their own bedrooms, get out on the VR and interact that way. So I think that could be a hindrance to social growth. But maybe give kids who are sick or something a better way to do it without risking their health or anything."
02:10:00
Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Their parents. The parents? And the professionals. I mean obviously professionals are going to know more of the outcomes to guide them. Can you give me an example of professionals that should be involved in the decision making? I would say like medical doctors or even like eye doctors or maybe somebody who studies the brain. We obviously know that electronics from parental adult is not great for them to have it all the time.
02:38:00
"Maybe not having the choice, but having the education and the voice to do it. But other than that, I think it's the parent until a certain age, they would make that choice. That makes a lot of sense, okay. So when creatives design VR for kids and families, what important things they should keep in mind? Things that they should keep in mind."
02:56:00
"Price. Price. Okay, tell me more. I know what one of those costs, because I have one, and they're 500 bucks a pop. So if you have a family of two, three, four, and you want to do this as a family, you're dropping $1,500 on this. You know, that's not necessarily beneficial for your average family. It would be more for those who are, they have some extra cash to throw around more. And the other part about it is,"
03:25:00
"just maybe not having access to even the Wi-Fi or things like that. So it could really limit in that sense. Anything else that we should consider when creating these experiences for children? I would say access. Access, okay. So access, yeah? Yeah, access. Like when I go on my VR right now, I can pretty much download any game or anything like that. And so I could go in and..."
03:49:00
"find a fighting game with guts and glory and all that stuff. They would definitely want to make sure that there's maybe a way where there has to be approval to download some of those. Or there's chats, where if I went into it, I could have a hundred other people in there. And I don't know who they are, or what conversations are being had, or what kind of language is being used. So basically, safety."
04:12:00
"around content and access to other people. Right. So you want some sort of supervision. People pretending to be someone that they're not. Or tracking. Oh, privacy, okay. Privacy, yeah. Because let's say something was happening or someone was grooming someone. Being able to possibly figure out some of that information or be able to track it or figure that out. Like right now I could at least go back and see text records or chat records, you know? But if you're in a virtual chat, how do you do that?"
04:42:00
"sure that my 11 year old child is safe, not talking to some creepy 56 year old man who is trying to be friends with the kind of thing. Is there anything else that you want to tell me about W.R.? Like, that we didn't talk about or I didn't ask about? I think it's a great tool for life. I mean, just like any other thing, it can be used for wonderful things, especially in classrooms. You might have schools that could afford..."
05:07:00
"a few of these in class, but not afford to take them to a huge field trip or something. So I think even if, let's say the government or something did some funding, they get maybe some of the lower end tools to have some of this. They can have some of those experiences that their family or other things wouldn't afford like some others might. Oh, that's wonderful. Anything else? I think that's it for now. Oh my gosh, wonderful. Thank you so much."
