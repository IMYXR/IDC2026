"Okay, we will just record your answers, make sure that we don't miss anything that you say. So the very first question is, what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? And what parts of these stories stood out to?"
"You like, was there anything that you notice in the video at home? The way that they use the headsets?"
Child  0:27
I assume like video are goals... (?)
Researcher  0:34
"No? And like, specifically the video that you watched about the one at home, were those I think it was like the kids playing with the headsets or sorry, at school, where it was the students learning about or like learning within the classroom with their headset. When you kind of think about that, what parts of like the school stories stood out to the video that you watch?"
Speaker 1  0:58
"About, like, seeing dinasours. Cause...in third grade I went to musuem and it was like, mostly about dinasours somethings."
Researcher  1:12
"do you think that like using the headsets was helpful? Like they got to learn about dinosaurs from their own classroom? Yeah. Great. Um, what kinds of problems might VR headsets create for you as a kid? Maybe even in your own life?"
Child  1:30
Maybe I will put a lot of attentions to what was going on.
Researcher  1:33
"attention. Right. Yeah. Like maybe the potentially distract you? Do you think you could be like that? Like, possibly spending too much time on it. Yeah. Who do you think should decide whether like VR experiences are a good choice for kids? Like, do you think there are any adults in your life or people in your life that can maybe make rules about whether like VR when you can use VR? Things like that? Yeah. Uh, huh. Can you give us some examples? Do you know any adults within your life?"
Child  2:05
My mom and dad.
Researcher  2:07
"Yeah. And like, what do you think they would like put rules about, like,"
Child  2:12
not spending too much time?
Researcher  2:15
"Right. Yeah, exactly. And when VR makers create VR experiences for kids and families, what are some things like what do you think they should keep in mind when they design like, VR headsets like that?"
Child  2:32
"Maybe it should have like, a time limit, like, Uh, huh. Like 30 minutes and then like, a break,"
Researcher  2:42
"right? Like a break query. That's really smart. And what about like, specific games? Or maybe even like specifically how the headset was? Was it comfortable for you to wear or do you think that maybe could be more comfortable?"
Child  3:00
I think they're good.
Researcher  3:02
It was not like difficult for you to where you knew kind of what was going on? Or do you think that maybe the game was confusing? What did you think about that?
Child  3:13
My sister was right here but in VR is in another location.
Researcher  3:17
"Yeah, yeah. So your positions in real life are different than the positions within the virtual reality that was in the rooms. Yeah, and is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for families you have any other comments you want to say?"
Child  3:53
"Nothing really, that's okay. Don't worry."
