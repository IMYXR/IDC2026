Unknown Speaker  5:16
It was confusing.
Speaker 1  5:18
Yeah. How was it on the stories when they use VR? What did you think about?
Speaker 2  5:27
"I think that like, it's good to, like, see shuttle? Or when, like, if you can just like when you're across like, the world from someone or like, I, you can't like travel to them. But I think it's also that you shouldn't do it too much. Yeah,"
Speaker 1  5:53
"for sure. Do you think there's any like foreigners to using VR? I think that's kind of what you're hinting at. What? Like, is there? What are some issues or like bad, bad things about VR? Do you think"
Speaker 2  6:07
"you can get dizzy? For sure? Like you might get, you might be doing too much. Or"
Speaker 1  6:26
"who you think should decide about different VR? experiences? Like, should it be adults, parents, teachers shouldn't be the kids,"
Speaker 1  6:36
I think. wait what?
Speaker 1  6:41
"Like, who should decide about VR?"
Unknown Speaker  6:43

Speaker 1  6:49
"Like, they're different experiences like this space, but there can be like video games, there can be educational thing."
Speaker 2  6:55
"I think it depends on what you want, are"
Unknown Speaker  7:01
"examples. Like,"
Speaker 2  7:07
"if it's for, like a teacher, then I'd say, I do like in educational [way]. But then, like, if it's just like parents, then like, they might say, like, you want. Like, the parent might say"
Speaker 2  7:38
"you have to like, tell me what you're doing. Before you do, then we'll decide what? Well, like, I don't know how the VR headset works. But like, is it like, do you play on a TV? Or play on a TV and then you just put your headset on? Yeah, so there's like"
Speaker 1  7:58
a phone in there. So whatever you can watch on a phone you should like.
Speaker 2  8:01
"So like, maybe just do it on a TV and then like, just have a  TV watch what you're doing? Yeah, casting to a TV"
Speaker 1  8:12
"When people are creating different VR experiences for children, what do you what should they keep in mind?"
Speaker 2  8:20
"Keep in mind, like what would parents? want"
Speaker 1  8:25
"And then finally, is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for children for families or anything related to your own experience?"
Unknown Speaker  8:36
Make some lighter headsets
Speaker 1  8:38
"lighter. Yeah. Was it a little bit too heavy? Yeah, did it hurt your head?"
Speaker 2  8:42
"Not too much. Just felt heavy. So harder for me to like, remember to like, and maybe like, like in the game, maybe like you should see like, it's your stuff on your head, like a helmet or something? Because it does like a helmet on they'll don't just like make it heavier than like, if you're just making peel really like,"
Speaker 1  9:06
