"Okay, so what did you think about the use of VR and the stories and what kind of stood out to you? Do you want to start?"
Child  0:07
"So the last video I watched, he was writing a hospital people come in, he couldn't walk. So he was learning how to walk in exercises. And his parents gave him VR. And the doctor gave him more exercises. But he didn't do it."
Researcher 0:31
what did you think about that?
Child  0:34
He shouldn't really be doing that. I thought that he should be doing the exercises.
It was. So there was like a giant balls in the Midwest. He couldn't go to their grandparents like they normally do for winter break. So they used VR to be playing play together. That was very nice.

So what do you guys think are some like benefits and it's not so good things?
Child  1:06
"can be kind of distracting some time, I think. I think that's your honest, so much of it is benefit. But it's also benefit children. Because with the first doctors, they use VR to help entertain the C T MRI."
Researcher 1:33
Yeah.
Child  1:36
"I thought kinda of mix. Because people use them in different ways. So like, if they're just using it for granted, and maybe you can, like, pick specific times feature, like using it for like education, or like socializing? I am. I think it's a good thing."
Researcher 1:53
"Yeah. For sure. What do you guys think should decide like my opinion, which would be our kids are able to make that decision is"
Child  2:01
probably their parents.
Researcher 2:05
"parents, or anyone else? Or just a parent?"
Child  2:12
Or they might have a little bit others?
Researcher 2:19
Yeah. And then when people who are like recreating this VR experiences are what should they keep in mind?
Child  2:27
"I think what's the thing they should keep in mind that some kids should play, should be like, healthy for kids. They should watch for that. I also think that they should make sure like, even a little bit of education and do it."
Child2  2:43
"Yeah, even if it's just like Minecraft or something. Yeah,"
Researcher 2:47
yeah. And then is there anything else you want to tell me about your family?
Child  2:53
I know it can help kids... if they're doing homeschool but they still want to learn with teacher.
Child2  3:07
"If children are disabled so like they can use VR like pretend wellbeing. it's an help them with like, whatever opens up thier mind."
Researcher 3:19
And then do you guys want to talk a little bit about your experience with the VR headset? How was that?
Child  3:26
"I personally really liked spaces down the street was also pretty cool because he got to move like in the ISS. So I thought, for sure."
Child2  3:41
I thought it was cool because I also liked science and I don't usually get to use VR. So that's what I like to bash for sure.
