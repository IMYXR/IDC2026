We're going to start asking you what did you think about the VR in these stories and what part of these stories stood out to you?
00:10:00
What did you think about these uses of VR for families? I think they're pretty interesting.
00:18:00
VR and you watched in the context of home and school.
00:33:00
"school would be better. Yeah. So how about more? The school, you know, you have a time to use a VR, so you have that set time. You're only in school for a certain time. Whereas at home, you don't really have a set time. You can tell the kids to go to bed or whatever, but they won't. I mean, that's how I see it. Right. You know. And it's kind of hard to hide things now because they find that they think so."
01:01:00
"So, kind of thinking about what you said that could be useful, how can children use VR in positive or useful ways, helpful ways? Well, it seems more real than just learning it and textual. Some people learn visual than just reading about it. They're able to visit a specific area and see and like..."
01:23:00
"feel how I felt in the space ship. It's a different experience than just reading about it or looking at videos. You're actually there and you're actually in the setting. So it feels more real. You're more able to pay attention and not wander off. Yeah, so more immersive. Yeah. So what kind of problems might VR create for your kids or for kids and families in general?"
01:53:00
"It depends on where they're played at, you know what I mean? Something more. Like, if they're at school, obviously they have to get a teacher to take care of them. But at home it's more harder to keep track. Because for me, I know I get busy and I don't really pay attention to them sometimes. So I just kind of let them watch TV sometimes just to get my stuff done."
02:23:00
"But, I don't know. So it's harder for you to keep track of how long they're on the VR? Yeah, how long. And what else? Yeah, how long, basically. Okay, pretty much. Okay. Are you worried about what they're watching? That too, yeah. Who's watching it with them?"
02:49:00
"you know, if they're talking to who they're really talking to. Oh, okay, so worried about their safety. Yeah, yeah. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for kids, or good choices for kids? Uh, parents, for sure. Parents, yeah. Is there other people that you think that should be involved in that decision-making? Teachers, to parents. Yeah, just stay with that."
03:16:00
"When creators design VR for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind? Safety, safety... What else? I mean everything other than that is pretty cool. I mean, can everybody use this? Yeah, I don't know."
03:38:00
"This is the first time I've ever seen this. Oh, I see. Like you're asking like, can everybody mean like access? Yeah, can everybody ask? Or no? Yeah, you can buy it. Oh. They're very expensive. Oh. Yeah. Oh, I see you're saying like, oh, like access perspective. Anybody do that? Yeah."
03:58:00
"Is there anything else that you want to tell us about the VR that you thought of but didn't get the chance to speak about? Talk about? No? I just really like how it was real. Like, I just get a different experience, you know? Not as like, oh, it's just seeing it. You're actually there. Before you feel like you can do certain things."
04:25:00
"Okay, well awesome. Thank you so much. Yeah, you're welcome."
