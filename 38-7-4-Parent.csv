Participant  6:58
Okay.
Researcher  6:59
"We have some questions here. So you have through the education and family scenario. Okay, so what did you think about the use of VR in these stories?"
Participant  7:09
What did I think about?
Researcher  7:09
What did you think about use of VR in these stories?
Participant  7:14
"So for family, I liked the idea of them being able to play games together, at a distance, and be connected in that way. For education, I see some benefits good, but I also think kids need hands on learning as well."
Researcher  7:28
"Aha, So, how can children and family use VR in positive and helpful ways?"
Participant  7:37
"Like you said, that idea of them being in different states and being able to connect with one another?"
Researcher  7:43
Yeah. What kinds of issues or problems might VR are created for your child? Or like for your family? Are there some issues or problems?
Participant  7:55
"I just worry about the health effects of lights, like headaches?"
Researcher  8:01
Are there any other issues you feel?
Participant  8:06
I like that it connects family but it also disconnects people like the boy playing Minecraft with his friends. I think it's better for kids to play outside together if they can.
Researcher  8:14
Yeah. So are there any issues you found in the education scenario?
Participant  8:19
"Ummm, the history one I liked the idea of them being able to teleport to places back in time. For science, again, I think there are certain scenarios where hands on learning is better."
Researcher  8:32
"So, who should decide which VR experience are suitable for children? It's a big question."
Participant  8:40
Yeah.
Researcher  8:43
Like parents or educators or like others government so maybe.
Participant  8:50
"I think, parents, educators, if it's in moderation. To have it an entire day of that for schooling I think is too much. Yeah"
Researcher  9:01
"So, are there any other stakeholders you can think of?"
Speaker 3  9:04
I say maybe parents and educators. Mostly parents.
Researcher  9:10
"I see, gotcha. Ummm, so when creators design VR for kids and families what important things should they keep in mind. Do you have any suggestions for/to VR makers?"
Participant  9:28
Can I just have you repeat that?
Researcher  9:29
"Like, when creator design VR for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind."
Other researcher  9:37
What do you think we should have in mind to better serve?
Participant  9:45
"I like the idea of being able to play games together, to connect people"
Researcher  9:50
"Yeah, so probably like, more interesting game or like, more attractive for children."
Yeah. yeah yeah
"Do you feel like, it is still heavy to wear or connect, for the hardware?"
Speaker 3  10:03
"Yes it's heavy and it feels like it's about to fall off, so yeah"
Researcher  10:09
Okay that's all the stuff. Is there anything else you want to tell me about using VR for kids?
Participant  10:15
"No, thank you"
Researcher  10:16
Okay nice
