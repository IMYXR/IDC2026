"What did you think about the use of VR kind of stood out to you,"

"I think, at school, that they didn't have to go into school... that they could stay at home. But I also think that giving a student of VR and telling them, they can only use it for school, they might get distracted and use it to play games and watch their own videos, that it might be a problem, especially for younger students. And but I also think it's helpful if like, someone gets sick, or if they're, or if it's like, not possible for them to go to school, or some way that they can still be in school without going there. At the doctor, I think that in like the exam, that younger kids who are afraid of the equipment they use, can go into like a whole nother world and make them feel more happy and safe. That that will help them so they can get the procedure done as quickly as possible, and solve the problem. But in the second video, of the doctor's office, the when he wasn't doing his exercises, and go to that creates a problem, because then he won't be able to do stuff normally again, because he's just distracted. That even though he's distracted from the pain, it'll just cause more problems from like for them later. Because they wouldn't have done they would just worse distracted."

So what do you think are some like benefits of using VR and some not so good things about what

"if, like, at school, could, they went on like the virtual like field trip, and they could go, like, if the school couldn't provide the money to actually have them go there, or the place itself was closed, they could go and they can learn a lot about different stuff. Because even though they didn't have to, like physically go there. And then just helping kids distracted from like pain, and making them feel more safe is, is good."

"And then when the people who are making like all these VR experiences, like this face when you were just in or like the squirrel ones, when people are making those, what should I keep in mind?"

"That maybe not, like, make it as high because some kids might be afraid. And they wouldn't want to use it ever because of the different like, heights and stuff and that they might look at like look down and have that be like, Oh, that's high, and then that and then they would never want to use it because they're afraid or they could get motion sick."

"For sure. And then is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for families? Now, is there anything you want to share about your experience using the VR headset?"

"I think it was it was fun, and it can be used in multiple ways and like learning and like, you might never be able to see like go to the ISS. But seeing it on VR is really cool."
