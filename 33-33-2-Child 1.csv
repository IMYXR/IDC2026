So what did you think about the use of VR in the stories?
Speaker 0  0:06
"I thought it was. Interesting. So I saw it in many ways that this could go horribly wrong. So, for example, school environment is fun, we can even see in the story, and of course, that is from the image designers imagination, well, we can see he appears to higher on his eyes are kinda .... Of course, it's not in color, so we can't quite see and again, color and imagination, but that could actually happen. And it would have the benefits of kids maybe not wanting to do video games, because they're gonna be so tired to screen. Oh, on, yay, I finally have people to play chess with. But then there will also be the fact that it can too much screens, it's proven to lead to various mental disorders and disabilities."
Researcher  1:13
That's really great points.
Speaker 0  1:17
"I don't think maybe for a few classes, not every day type thing, but like, field trips and things like that. So you can still remain at school, we'll do a field trip type thing, but I don't same as like a full education or even part time education establishment program. I don't think it would work. Well, like that. And Ahan pointed out, because know what she says a good point. How did she make dinner? But then also, that was the way she asked me call several times to get them to come. You can eventually just become obsessed with it. And have you seen? Have you seen the movie or read the book? Ready Player One?"
Researcher  2:04
"Oh, I see that."
Speaker 0  2:05
"Yeah, we don't want to end up like them. So if our whole life was like that. But then then how soon into work at home jobs, or even jobs or even regular go to the office jobs become like that, or technology or until like full school becomes like, because eventually if our entire lives become online, that could lead to serious developmental difficulties in the human race."
Researcher  2:37
"That's really good answer, that's actually the best answer I've ever heard so far. I know you already mentioned measures demo problems might we are created to do want to add something like Are there any other issues or bad advice that VR used?"
Speaker 0  2:53
"So? Yes, actually. So I only saw three scenarios. And of course, you're not going to list 50 scenarios. But I thought a potential scenario. About.... Okay. Kind of school? Not in the same sense, though, what exactly what about college, there, you have a very, very useful college, because number one, because also by then, hopefully, your brain, your brain should be developed enough that hopefully shouldn't stop your brain growth by too much. But that it allows you to, like, I can remain in this room and go to the University of Maryland, well, still being in this room, or so like, I can go as long as I get accepted basically, in the bay, I can go to any college I want for example, without having to let go live there have been everything. So college virtual classes, I don't even think high school. But I feel like college has a very useful and patient. And again, field trips, all kinds of things."
Researcher  4:27
So what why you see college is different from your school as a primary so
Speaker 0  4:32
I did kind of say that your brain or your brains mostly developed in 25. But you are much older when you do college. The majority of people. So your brain role is higher.
Researcher  4:44
"Yeah. Oh, that's a good point. Yeah, and another point that is like this Why is heavy enough like, fall out like"
Speaker 0  4:53
"that could damage your neck, increased or younger schools that could hurt your neck? Nope. Sounds neck in heck, disfiguration. That is very interesting point like for younger people that could because disfiguration by wearing that too. Or if not disfiguration, at least serious breakups. Chiropractors would have a kick out of it."
Researcher  5:19
"Okay, I think so for sure decide which we are experienced are good choice."
Speaker 0  5:25
"So I don't think that there is currently in the present day, a single body that should decide that. And I do not saying any single body in the presentation have the right to decide that. Yeah. Because just the whole risk factors and everything. I just don't think it's right for any even group like that, or US government to decide that. I think it needs to be all big coalition."
Researcher  5:57
"Oh, so what types of?"
Speaker 0  5:59
"Yeah, what type of corelation? So it would have to be between, first of all, government. Second of all, we're going to need, like, doctors in the country, we need people who study economy, not businessmen themselves, because they're going to be biased. But we need like economic people who study economy, like for a living, we need economic doctors, too. So we need like, the government, we need economic doctors, because that's as close as we can get to business without being too like your favorite Tim on. And then we need doctors we need on like, because, again, just figuration or mental issues. We need a lot more research. And we need like Mayo Clinic, for example, like on this board to help decide, and the risks need to be weighed. And yeah, so I think a coalition between various economic doctors, the government, and somewhere like Mayo Clinic, I feel no, it would be best, if not even on that, because you get various viewpoints. But then also very important, you need the public opinion. So have open sessions where the public can come in and speak. You need like open sessions for the public's opinions."
Researcher  7:36
"Yeah, that's great. So my question were we are makers create VR experience for children? Or something very important, they should keep in mind so now I don't."
Speaker 0  7:47
"So if so, I just so I understand the question."
Researcher  7:50
"Oh, yeah. If VR makers want to create some. So like,"
Speaker 0  7:55
"if VR does become a thing for children, what is something they should keep in mind while making it?"
Researcher  8:00
"Yeah, that's right."
Speaker 0  8:03
"Actually is two things. Number one, downsize the headsets and make them lightweight, because that will be there solves so many problems. And then second of all, limited time, I'm kinda as I stated before, you can't do it like the entire school, they can't do it for your entire job. Like.. if we need to not have Ready Player One or similar type experience, what would I find needed to be limited, it can be used, but it needs to be applied in correct amount of time. Because too much can lead to destruction too little. And people are going to be like, Why don't we do more of this? So we want to push for probably too much. Yeah, so first of all, just yet the balance and like just installing something into the headset, that if you go too many straight hours on the headset, it shuts down and saves everything will then shuts down. And it's like no, you will take a few hour break. I'm not letting you back behind. Um, or like it just shuts down your account for that time. So You even can't log on to another place. And then just the design in general. And of course, these are fairly early prototypes. This is relatively new thing where Yeah, so those would be the two main things that I want to find."
Researcher  9:31
Yeah. Is there anything else you want to tell me about like how kids use VR.
Unknown Speaker  9:36
I think I cover them all.
