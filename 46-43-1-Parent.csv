"I think there's a lot of positives that can be used. Whether it's at home or at school, or in a lot of different situations, but gives teachers and professionals a lot of different options to use with everybody, not just kids, but everybody,"
Researcher  0:30
"what's the biggest advantages of using VR, you thought"
Speaker 1  0:35
"with our time and where we're at, in the last, you know, five to 10 years, you know, allowing kids to be with each other, allowing kids."

Communicate with most things
Speaker 1  0:50
"Yeah, communication. You know, the history aspect would be awesome, you know, being able to go back to a event in, in time and see it firsthand instead of just reading it out of a book."
Researcher  1:05
"Yeah, that makes sense. So what kinds of issues are problems with VR use this case?"
Speaker 1  1:10
"Well, I mean, like, with any form of social media, electronics, you know, the overuse can be if they're using it too much. You know, that? I mean, but that's, you know, that's with anything, that's a TV, that's a radio, that's new, your iPad, anything could cause that. So."
Researcher  1:36
"Yeah, gotcha. I said, so based on the issues you just mentioned, who should decide which VR experience is suitable for kids."
Speaker 1  1:46
"I think, you know, the parents, if you have it as a teacher, you know, a combination of the parents and the teachers, you know, talking about, you know, how much it's being used? So, you know, I think the adults, you know, I think there should be a combination of, you know, made"

With kids
Speaker 1  2:11
"Well, you know, the parents, the teachers, the adults that are responsible for the children."
Researcher  2:17
"Yeah, gotcha, that makes sense. So, when, when creator design we are for kids and families, do you have any, like suggestions for them, or ideas or for something important, they should keep in mind."
Speaker 1  2:29
What was that? One more time.
Researcher  2:30
"So when creator design, VR for kids, do you think that there's something important for them to keep in mind."
Speaker 1  2:39
"I think details, just make sure, you know, like, the original video, we saw just the details around it, you know, being able to see what's, you know, physically there being able to"
Researcher  2:50
improve the quality of the author content?
Speaker 1  2:53
"Yes. It makes sure, you know, history, you know, if you're doing something historically, you know, make sure it's historically accurate, you know"
Researcher  3:01
Ah yes.
Speaker 1  3:02
"Something to keep the person engaged, whether it's a story or a place or things like that. You know, just make sure that there's visual, you know, I think a lot of it's visual, you know,"
Researcher  3:19
so make the visual and the content appropriate for kids.
Speaker 1  3:22
Yes.
Researcher  3:25
So is there anything else you want to tell me about using VR for kids?
Speaker 2  3:29
"I think it's a great tool. I think it's a great tool. It's like any other tool out there. There's a lot of positives.My daughter always uses really basic passwords, likeher name. Inputting the password by the VR controlleralso prevents her from setting up a more secure one. There could be some negatives, you know, if you will about with that with"
Researcher  3:41
Over use it.
Speaker 1  3:42
"any with any any type of electronic, you know, so. No, it was awesome."
