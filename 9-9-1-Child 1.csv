"I think in school, it could work. because like, that's how things of learning but at home, it might not be as good of an idea if everyone's on a VR headset kind of like makes them distant and like it's kind of gets connected to the internet too much."

Yeah. So can you elaborate more like how it was good or bad?
Speaker 2  6:03
"At school, like you could learn more from like watching a video about it. And like getting a real life experience. But like, at home, you could just be on your thing on your like tablet the whole time. And especially if you're playing with friends on the internet, instead of going outside. Isn't that good to do?"

Researcher 7:39
What did you think about like your own experience with it?
Child  7:44
