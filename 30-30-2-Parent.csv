"I'm going to start asking you about what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of these stories stood out to you in the context of home and education that you watched? Yeah, I feel like they were very different scenarios, not knowing much about VR itself. I think it seems interesting for some kids to do it together as long as it's not violent. I'm a non-violent person."
00:27:00
study of the space stuff seems very relevant to like even school stuff where I can definitely see like going to states or going to museums like seeing what if it's like real life pictures of what it is they're actually seeing I feel like that's a lot of educational than trying to read it out of a textbook and it seems like it'd be a lot more engaging than just reading it out of a textbook.
00:57:00
"Okay, so that's like what you think about like benefits of using VR. Yeah. Yeah, is there other ways that you can think that children can use it in a positive or helpful ways? I mean the scenario of doing it with the grandparents, like when I was reading the questions, part of it is like, well, what if they could just do it via Zoom? So it was just like more engaging. I think that the VR, while I don't know if you can actually talk with it, seems like..."
01:25:00
a little bit more isolating than just being like in a room and like you talking normally as if you were really here even though you're on the computer.
01:36:00
Isolating in this guy. Okay. So what kinds of problems or issues might be our create for kids? For your kids or for these kids or for kids in general and families. Yeah. Yeah I think kids could potentially like Too much time on the devices I feel like kind of the world itself is kind of getting pigeonholed into technology
02:03:00
"While pool, I feel like it could be limiting. And again, more just like non-violent games. So you're thinking about the content? Yes. Okay. Is there other concerns?"
02:20:00
"Obviously if a kid gets too obsessed with it and that's all they want to do. But I feel like sometimes I'm just teenagers in general. My kids have retreated to doing their own thing. Luckily neither one of them are big into gamers or technology and that kind of stuff. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for kids or good choices for kids? I mean obviously parents, teachers."
02:48:00
"but also hopefully the kids instilling good morals in what to watch. I would hope my son doesn't just pick up a game and do all shooting, stabbing shows. Not shows, but whatever that is. Reality stuff. It was interesting because they used the word teleporting, and I was thinking of a time when my son was in church, and he's like, can I just teleport to Shelly's?"
03:16:00
"I don't know, I don't know. I don't know."
03:35:00
amount of screen time so like if it could be limited to like an hour or two like I would hate to have a kid retreat to their room for four or five hours in a day like steady just doing it.
03:50:00
"Yeah, timing."
03:55:00
"Is there anything else that you want to tell me about or thought about? Tell us about VR, thought about, but you didn't get the chance to talk about? No, there's none. No?"
