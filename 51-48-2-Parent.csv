"So tell us what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what part of these stories stood out to you? You watch both in the health and the education context. I guess from the health care context one, my concern was about the device itself and if it's compatible with MRIs. You know, and all the metal and stuff that's in it, since I'm a nurse and so like..."
00:26:00
"we're concerned about the safety of those things too. So that's what stood out, but I think the use of it in the medical field is also very helpful for us."
00:38:00
"distraction and things like that, like patients that had pain in these stories, I think it'd be very helpful in those situations. And then for the school scenarios, I thought it was awesome how they took them right to Boston so they could teach history that way and immersing the kids in those areas, especially if the kids are never going to get a chance to go to those places in person. So I really like that, that they could totally immerse them in the experience. Okay, can you think about there? I'm just going to ask you this question, like how can children and families..."
01:08:00
"use VR in positive or helpful ways other than that way you mentioned. Is there other context beneficial for them? Yeah, so I think too like as we look at you know like as kids grow up and like dealing with like different relationship type things too even putting them in those settings where it's like maybe a safe place to express their feelings and do it in a way where they can"
01:32:00
"either get the feedback on what would be better to say in a situation or just give them the courage to say the things that they want to say in a situation. Oh, that's a full use. What kind of issues or problems might VR create for your children or for children and families? I think part of it too is there is that aspect of..."
01:57:00
"like a community when they're playing on it, but then there's also the isolation piece of it too where they're playing on it all the time. And so then maybe they're not spending as much time with their friends as they otherwise could because they're on a device. The other thing that I think about too is..."
02:15:00
"issues with eyesight as you're like have this on your face all the time and you're looking around and like there's all that stimuli and all that light that's on there then it may impact your eyesight too over time. Okay, who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Um so I think the parents certainly have a role in that especially at home but I think the teachers too really have the expertise to"
02:42:00
"to figure out which ones work best in the classroom, especially for the curriculum that they're trying to teach. Okay, okay. Is there any situation in which VR should not be used?"
02:54:00
"that I can think of right now. OK, so when creators and developers of VR experiences design VR for kids and families, what important things they should keep in mind?"
03:07:00
"So I think that culture should always play a piece in it. Culture? Yes. Can you explain? Making sure that the content is diverse enough, and it has enough cultural aspects in it, so everybody's not the same avatar. There's different cultural aspects of the avatars. And then also, I think of traumatic experiences. So making sure that either there's a warning, like if it would trigger something"
03:37:00
Just being very conscious of that content when it's being created. So appropriate content for kids. Anything else that we should consider? Okay. Is there anything else that you want to tell us about the VR for your kids or children that you thought of and you didn't get a chance or we didn't ask about it? No. No? No. No worries?
