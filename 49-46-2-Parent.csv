"Okay, great. Can you tell us what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of these stories stood out to you? I think VR is great for distraction and in the case of the healthcare situations of pain and going into an imaging machine where people might be claustrophobic, I think it's a good thing to distract people."
00:24:00
"As far as using VR myself, I guess it's probably not the best thing because it does make me kind of motion sickness or it gives me nausea. But I really like the last video that I watched in the home because I know my nephew uses VR and plays those games and things. But thinking about it in a different way where you might"

I used it outside the box of what I would normally.
01:04:00
"Especially during COVID, right?"
01:11:00
"So kind of along these sides, like what other case scenarios that you can think of that could be beneficial for children and family to use it? Or how can children, yeah, in a positive way, so helpful ways? I just think like the connection piece. I like the connection piece. During COVID, I would try to connect with my nieces and nephews because I was at the bedside and never saw my family."
01:41:00
"I see it similar to that. It's more real life, obviously, virtual reality."
01:53:00
"then it's good, you know? So what kind of problems or issues might VR create for children and families? Addiction. And the Minecraft thing, I struggle with that because I know he, I think he played Minecraft or some similar game. It's a good thing because he does connect with his friends."

during COVID.
02:25:00
I'm not

"system not have some sort of rules around games. It's like this whole idea of gaming and phones and things like that. Can you tell us a little bit more what you foresee? Some of the issues that arise? Yeah, so just... So as much as you can communicate with people in this environment."
02:54:00
"I am also a nurse-imprimitition, so I totally love all things tech. There's the risk of losing personal connection, just like with all these TikTok and other apps, right? Kids don't write full sentences anymore."
03:22:00
"When I grew up I was just stacking on the phone and saw people in real life. Not that they don't see people in real life, it's just that they connect better using electronics."
03:36:00
"So, social skills and... Social skills, yeah. Social connection and everything. Attention. Face to face, yeah. Attention, based on writing full sentences. Okay, great. Um, who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Well, society chooses that, right? And then it's the parent. Society, okay. So, society who creates these tools, right? The tech industry or, you know."

scientists at our one institution but it's ultimately the decision of the parent and then once a child gets to be autonomous or whatever age a parent thinks that they can make their own decision then you know it's the child's decision or the young adults or the adults decision. Is there any situations in which VR should not be used by children or for children?

"I can't think of any unless there is bowling. I know you asked that in your question. So if there's a case where that would bring upon a turn between friends or students or whatever, then that wouldn't be good. But in all the situations that I saw or thought about, I think it's fine within reason. When creators and computer scientists design VR experiences for kids and families, what important things they should keep in mind?"
05:07:00
"Well, the entire family experience and the fact that adults make the decisions for children. So I did my immersion at Children's Hospital and the first eye-opener for me was that you're caring for the parent just as much as you are the child. So I'm not a parent myself, but..."
05:42:00
"Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about VR for families that didn't get the chance to say? Yeah, I don't think so. Okay, great. Awesome. Thank you so much."
