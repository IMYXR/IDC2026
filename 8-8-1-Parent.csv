R: let’s start off with what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of these stories stood out to you?
00:17:00
P: I feel like a lot of it is already being done online and the VR just enhances it. So it's not any different than how we talk to grandparents or how kids are doing online school.
00:30:00
R: Can you talk a little bit more about what parts of that has already been done?
"P: Well, just like, you know, we're doing FaceTime or video conferencing, right? So VR is just a little bit different version of that, but it's not like it's brand new, right? Or like, you know, my son is doing, you know, during COVID he was doing online school, so VR would just make it, add different dimensions to it, right? But not like something that's completely different."
00:56:00
R: So how can children and family use VR in maybe helpful ways or positive ways?
"P: Well, I think again, if it helps them immerse into that world a little better, sometimes it's easier to learn or to feel connected or to communicate better. I think that is allowing, you know, you're allowing a little bit more immersive feeling into the environment."
01:22:00
"What kind of problems might VR create for your kid or just for children in general? I mean in general, you know, when the thing's on, you're disconnected, right? I mean, yeah, you can be like augmented so you can see outside, but you know, I guess just like we're worried about screen time already, but this is just going to be a much more probably fun way for kids that they're not going to want to take it off or want to"
01:50:00
"And also, you know, at some level, it's good to explore things outside their community, but it's also good to be connected to where they are locally, right? So finding the right balance of that. And, you know, just like everything else, how do we monitor what's available, right? You know, is he watching stuff that we would approve of or, you know, it might not be bad, but is that what we want him to do? Like, it's just, you know, especially on the screen, we can see it, right? We can look over his shoulder with VR."
02:20:00
"could just be having this experience and we had no idea what he was watching necessarily. So you want ways, and we'll talk about this in a second, so who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? I think parents have a responsibility and along with the children themselves."
02:42:00
"Do you think of other examples of people or entities who might be involved in making the decisions? I mean I'm sure everyone likes to get involved but ultimately it's my responsibility to make sure what he's watching is okay. Got it. Okay. I mean it would be nice to have like, you know, whatever. You know how like, you know, doctors approve or teachers approve or someone you trust approves but at the end of the day it's still my responsibility so it's okay."
03:11:00
"It'd be nice to know, like, you know, four or five of our best friends have heard. But, like, you know, I don't care if a celebrity or some other person. I mean, I don't know that person. I mean, it's different. You know, our rules in our family or what I want from my son is different than everyone else."
03:29:00
"I think parents, ultimately. Yeah, I appreciate you saying that, yeah. So kind of following back on our earlier, when creators design VR for children, possibly for families, what are important things that they should keep in mind?"
03:45:00
"Um, you know, I think just being... I mean, every family's gonna be different. Every kid's gonna be different. You know, even level of, let's say like, violence or difficult subjects. You know, every kid is different. So just being transparent about what's in the video. So the content, yeah? The content. And I don't know if there's different ways. You know, like movies have different ratings or whatever. Something like that would be helpful so that, you know..."
04:12:00
"I mean the best thing is if we pre-watch it first and then before we let him, but again these worlds are so big, you know, it's hard to know everything that's in there. So some way to like gauge what is appropriate for my own child. Do you want like a way to see what he's experiencing? That would be great. I just don't know how, I mean like I said it makes sense but again that means like..."
04:38:00
"To be honest, a lot of times we use screen as a distraction, right? But like, if I have to be paying attention, then it's not helpful. But, yes, I mean, if there's some way that we can find out what he's watching at any time, that would be helpful. Can you think of other examples or considerations? Of what? Of considerations to create these or design these experiences."
05:05:00
I don't know. I mean a lot of it is thinking through like what is actually going to be helpful. I mean games are fun but you know are they a really good learning environment? If there's ways you can say well you know you're learning.
05:18:00
"your math skills or problem-solving skills or whatever this experience helps my childhood, that would be helpful to know. So I'd be like, okay, yeah, that's, you know, you could be learning these things or maybe interacting with these things. Obviously, like the space station environment, you know, a lot of things, are we just looking at things? Is there any kind of narration that comes or is it just self-expiration? I mean, all those are fine, but like, again, the different"
05:49:00
"comparing to like, is it better for him to read a book or to do this? You know, it would be helpful as a parent to know like, what benefit he's getting out of VRX."
06:01:00
"Okay, one last question. Is there anything else that you want us to know about VR for kids and families that you thought of but didn't get the chance to talk about? In general, I talked to the person who did it, you know, the person who was saying that Facebook is sponsoring this, that MEDA is sponsoring this, right? I mean, it depends on how much you trust these corporations, right? So like, it would be, I mean that's actually my biggest hang up with getting the Oculus. I'm like, I don't want to be part of the Facebook."
06:29:00
"I want something that's neutral to be doing this. I don't know if I trust... A corporation that has all this information on me, specifically, to be... I don't know if I can trust that. So there's a little bit of... Everything's kind of tied into that consideration about like..."
06:46:00
"what's important or what would I allow into my house? We don't do Amazon, we don't do like, what is the, Echo, right? Because we don't want them in the house. But we have a cell phone so we have to deal with some of that, right? But, you know, so that's hard. I mean, is this just another piece of corporations, you know, collecting our information? Is that the concern is privacy and security? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I'm not expressing that well. I'm just curious. Yeah, I mean, I think that's part of it, is that what do we give up?"
07:16:00
"for these experiences. It's not as benign as just like, oh here's a book or here's a video you can watch."
07:24:00
"There's other stuff that's collected that we're concerned about. What was the concern? If this is data that is collected to enhance your experience or if there's other concerns that this data being used? Well, I mean Facebook collects information that they make money on, right? Our personal information they sell, right? So transparency basically. But in order for Oculus to work, we have to sign in on Facebook, right? You have to have an account. Otherwise you have to pay more for the system, right? I see. So like, it's not like..."
07:54:00
"you're buying this thing that they don't care about. They benefit from us buying it, taking the data, that even if it's as simple as who's signing in or who's watching what, where does that go? And especially concern for minors. For kids, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just curious, have you thought of an alternative?"
08:15:00
"What would, like what an alternative? Honestly, I just don't trust Facebook. Yeah, I get it, I get it. If they're making this system, I would buy it. Let's say there's another entity making this. Yeah, if I don't have to sign in or, you know, if it's like a TV, you buy a TV, although I'm pretty sure they collect like, you know, you put it in a DVD or whatever and you can watch it. It's just, it's separate, it's totally separate. This one you have to log in, you know, it's tracking where you're watching and all this stuff. I don't know if I trust it."
08:43:00
"Got it, got it, got it. So collect data enough to enhance your experience, but not necessarily share it with the culprit worlds. Yeah. Got it, yeah. Thank you so much. This has been really helpful. Is there anything else that you? No, this is fine. OK, great. Thank you. Yes. Appreciate you. Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day. You too."
