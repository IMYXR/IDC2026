"So I'm going to start by asking you, what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? First one, where it's a family where dad comes home and does his own thing, son goes and does his own thing, or child goes and does his own thing, mom goes out to do her own thing. There's that separation, there's no family connection. Everything's separate. They couldn't get ahold of each other to get down in time to eat dinner together as a family. That's important."

"technology is becoming intricate in our homes. We're losing the humanity. I see. Any other parts that stood out to you in other stories? The other story where the family wasn't able to go visit grandparents. If the grandparents had text-sabed, I think it's a wonderful idea to keep them together. In that respect, it's the opposite. It looks like it brought them together. They set up another opportunity to get together and the next night..."

"That'd be great having elderly parents, having a grandmother when I tried to do that. It was more chaotic than it was beneficial. I see. So just thinking about like how can basically VR be beneficial for kids and families? Can you think of ways that... It could help a child who might be struggling to interact and learn what they're trying to learn, maybe potentially helping with their math or..."
01:26:00
"other things with exhibits of, you know, like science, you know, being able to put in context what they're learning, what they've read, seeing it visually. I see. So you think that there could be a learning and educational value there. Any other positive ways that VR could be used by kids and families?"
01:47:00
"but I might not live to see that. Okay. What kinds of problems might VR create for children and families? Isolation. Isolation. Isolation, lack of communication, the dependency on the VR for entertainment, as opposed to trying to engage their parents. As children age, they're already going to be trying to separate from their parents. Now you throw something extra for them to disengage with their parents."
02:17:00
Is there any situation in which VR should not be used in your opinion?
02:28:00
"necessarily agree that in schools it should be necessarily used. Because in school you still need your teacher, you need your students, you need that discipline. And with VR, you're not having that communication skills being interacted, you're not having interactions with people. I think that's a skill that's being lost. You have people that are doing their homeschooling, you have people that want to work at home instead of going to the office. And those people skills are being lost."
02:57:00
"Okay, who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Who should?"
03:07:00
"It should be people that have kids, not some bureaucratic lonely who don't have kids, don't have experience with them, making rules and regulations. I think it should be parents and schools should be working together and not be a separation and against one another. You against me type mentality, I'm hearing not too much of this. I see, okay. When Kreato's designed VR for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind?"
03:38:00
Emphasizing some fashion and having some kind of message in there that you still need to have real life skills interacting with adults interacting with kids learning how to interact resolve problem solving things like that Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about VR or thought of but we didn't ask about That you want to share?
04:07:00
So I don't know that we're concerned. How would you be able to protect against cyber bullying if in fact you're able to...
04:17:00
"are there to ensure that age groups are within the age groups when they're doing the virtual and not having an adult in there with kids or kids with adults that shouldn't be in the age group. I see, so that's a concern that you have. Yeah. Is there anything else? Well, thank you so much for your participation today. That was really wonderful."
