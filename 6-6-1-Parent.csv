So what did you think about the use of VR in these stories?
00:08:00
I feel like it's beneficial. I feel like it's good in these circumstances.
00:18:00
"What parts of these stories stood out to you? The connecting with family, the connecting with the class or learning experiences really felt good. I think they were beneficial. My own boys use VR when they get home from school. They connect with their buddies and their friends. We just moved to Minnesota a while back, so they still connect with folks from Nebraska, where we're from."
00:48:00
"They're our friends from there, so that makes me feel good that they still connect with friends back home. And now they're making new friends here in Minnesota, so they're able to connect with new friends here in Minnesota via whatever games they're playing, and I like that."
01:08:00
"I think the one video, the last one I watched about the kid logging off for the day, I think they drew his eyes, he's tired because that's probably what would happen. He'd probably feel fatigued in that way. I think as technology progresses, yeah, I think the fatigue won't be there. Maybe we'll find ways to mitigate fatigue. His eyes looked fatigued... day in and day out it could be exhausting"
01:31:00
"Okay, so that was, yeah, let's talk about some of these maybe problems or issues that might VR create for children. Yeah. So fatigued, yeah? Fatigue, eyesight, maybe impatience. What do you mean by impatience? Impatience is in..."
01:49:00
"We already deal with them patients a lot with technology, with the phones, or if something's laggy, the Wi-Fi signal, things like that. Or if you have to put something on your head and it's not working properly. It's."
02:03:00
"Frustration can set in, maybe there could be potentially more damage or more costly damage to the piece of equipment. You know, if something's thrown out in anger, frustration, you know, a handle set, things like that."
02:21:00
"That's kind of where I can see that happening, you know, because I witnessed that. Even though they know I've drilled it into their head, this is very expensive to put in. You know, we have two oculoses at home, so be careful with this stuff. Very nice stuff. That's kind of it. I don't know, and then I guess I do think about the brain, their development, things like that."
02:47:00
"You know, we have phones now. They're always staring at screens these days in our lives. I don't know."
02:54:00
"I see benefits and things that are not so beneficial. Yeah, it can cause problems. What are some situations in which VR should not be used?"
03:11:00
There's potentially a lot of different situations for children especially and then also for adults.
03:22:00
"very scary things to think about, especially with kids."
03:31:00
I'm not going to be incurred what I'm talking about. I don't want to see.
03:38:00
"I always warn my boys when they're in a playing a game online with the VR. I don't know who they're playing with. I tell them. Do not talk about where you live. Tell them who you are, your name, anything. Just go with your gamertag."
03:59:00
"concerned around privacy and safety. Yeah, and then also be wary of conversation people can try and trick you into giving you information."
04:11:00
try to teach them about that.
04:14:00
"Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Sorry, can you repeat? Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Ultimately, I believe the parents or the guardian, right? And then I think..."
04:36:00
if it's used academically or if it's used in a profession where studies...
04:47:00
"I guess we just have to know about it and be educated more to know, understand how okay it would be. I guess I'd have to think about that. I don't know. I guess ultimately it would come down to the parents. But you feel like parents also need support, right? Yes. To make a informed decision. Got it. Yeah, we'd have to know about it and learn about it."
05:10:00
"So when creators design VR for children or for families, what are important things they should keep in mind? Always safety first of all, and privacy. I'm also weary of the platform games like Fortnite, the addicting qualities of video games."
05:41:00
"I understand that's part of the business, it has to happen sometimes, but in order to make money."
05:47:00
"That concerns me as well. Back to the concern, yeah. Can you think of maybe, I don't know if you can provide specific examples of some of these considerations when people create experiences for VR, besides addiction? Specific examples? Yeah, can you provide specific examples of these considerations that designers should keep in mind when they're creating VR for kids? Maybe, yeah, like..."
06:16:00
"imagery, you know, imagery content, or sexualized content. Oh, is that the deferred context that you were talking about earlier? Got it. Got it. Or even like the luring aspects too. I worry about that quite a bit. So I do talk to them frequently."
06:43:00
"and the addictive quality of wanting to spend money. Spending money on getting something, spending money to get points, getting a skin, getting a head in the game type of thing."
07:00:00
"It concerns me a lot. Yeah, yeah, totally. It's expensive. Is there anything else that you want to tell us about the VR for kids and family that you didn't get the chance to say earlier? I think it's going to become a part of our life. It already has in my household. It's become part of our life, the way it's used for our recreation and our entertainment. I think it's only going to become more a part of our life with how we..."
07:27:00
"work and how we study and how we live, it's just going to become normal, you know, pretty soon. So I don't know what you guys are, the ultimate outcome of your study is, but I'm excited. I'm glad you're doing it. Why are you glad we're doing it? To learn more. We always have to learn. We always have to understand."
07:55:00
"whatever it is there's to understand, you know, and we're not gonna understand everything ever, but I think it's a good thing. So you're hopeful about the future. This is like... Absolutely. Right. But you think that we should do this work with the guide, because it's not going anywhere. Well, I don't know what your ultimate outcome is, but absolutely. It would be my hope I suppose to guide and to..."
08:20:00
"It's helped people understand, to help us understand as we move to the future. As you're using this. Yes, we're using it. Thank you so much. You're welcome. This is wonderful. Thanks."
