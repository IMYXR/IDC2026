I started recording right now. So what did you think about the use of VR in the stories?
Participant  0:05
"I thought that I get concerned is a parent who is concerned about screen time with kids to having it available, kind of like in the scenario that the parents get home and the moms on VR cooking, and the dads on VR and the TV, and then the kids are on VR. Like, I just feel like there's not a ton of connection. Or like, again, if it's a special circumstance and grandparents, in the snow, and you can't get to them, I feel like that's probably a more of a one-off situation. So just probably the amount of time would be a concern for me. I think doing something like teleporting into a dinosaur exhibit is like, super cool. But if you're also doing this every day, I just worry again about interaction, social interactions among kids."

"so the screen time, should be limited?"
Participant  0:49
I Yes. Every parent is probably going to tell you that.
Researcher  0:53
I think you already mentioned some of this. But are there any other issues or problems? That VR creates for kids? Are there any other issues or problems?
Participant  1:03
"Um, you know, I guess I don't know enough about it to know if there are concerns with students, again, to your point cyber bullying or, again, the social interactions would be my concerns a lot. But again, I'd need to know more about it."
Researcher  1:18
Gotcha. So what types of things you want to know more about VR?
Participant  1:22
"I think how it connects with other sets? I mean clearly, like he and I were in that room together, Like, what are the opportunities for outside people to come in? Is there a possibility of that?"
Researcher  1:35
"That's a really good point. I fee like it's hard to force some newcomers to directly use it. Might need others' help to.. Yeah. Okay. So next one, would be a big question. So who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children?"
Participant  1:52
Who should.. ?
Researcher  1:54
Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children?
Participant  1:57
"Oh, you know, right now, a lot of video games and whatnot have kind of age rankings. I mean, I think that's helpful as a parent, just to say, Okay, what kind of content is in this? You know, I think that educators would be a good point, you know, again, if you're there for school, and you want to do a science experiment, or if you want to do some type of like history lesson, I think that would be really cool. Again, I think it would have to depend on educators working together with even state lawmakers or national lawmakers just to, again, keep everyone as safe as possible. Yeah. And parents, I mean, you know, like, if I don't agree with him having Minecraft, we're not on Minecraft, you know, then that would be appropriate too."
Researcher  2:41
"If you already have the VR headset do you think you can approve your kid to use this individually, or like most parents involved in the"
Participant  2:48
"I think it is probably both. I mean, I think there's guidelines like overall, but I've got to think if I don't want my kid to do that, then it'd be individual"
Researcher  2:57
great. So when creators design VR for kids and families. What's the important thing to keep in mind?
Participant  3:07
"That's a good question. I mean, I think as much education as possible? Probably trying to create something that kids can't do, in, you know, like, we can't go back in history. Right. So creating that environment, I think is super cool, right? We can't go back and see dinosaurs. So creating something like that. We can't go to space, right? So in creating environments that like you normally couldn't do, that would be super cool way to use this technology. I think if it is maybe playing Monopoly, like we can do that. You know, we can't do it with grandma and grandpa across like in Milwaukee, we can do that. So I think creating experiences that he probably can't do. That was what I think."
Researcher  3:49
"yeah, thank you so much. Is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for family or for kids?"
Participant  3:55
"Yeah, this is something I've- we've not done. As you can see, he had no experience with this before. Again, I just worry a lot about kids - like screen time, like, I mean, it's something that we fought a lot in our family and once you get in, then, it's so cool, right? So kids, of course would want to do that. So, that would be my one concern, or my one - irk. And you're gonna hear that a lot of parents"
Researcher  4:20
"Thank you so much for your time you've been a really big help. You can take us a student bag, or like an animal toy, which one you'd like"
