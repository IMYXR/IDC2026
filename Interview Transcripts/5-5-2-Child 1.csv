"So, so now we want to give you a chance to talk about what you think. So you choose this scenario about at home and at school? What did you think about about VR in that story?"
Child  7:22
It could help you but then you could be safer in there where kids bullying other kids on there. If you want just stop it. You can just take off the headset.
Researcher  7:37
"Yeah, yeah. That's actually a really good point. Do you see any like, benefits if you are using VR?"
Child  7:45
For effects for like class? You couldn't be able to get sick. Because you just you're at your house for your dorm room.
Researcher  7:56
Yeah. So how can children and families use VR in positive and helpful ways?
Child  8:05
It won't be messy when I'm doing like board games and stuff. I don't have to clean anything up. Oh
Researcher  8:16

Researcher  8:33
Yeah. Do you see any other
Child  8:36
changes being mean to you? Sweat people swearing
Researcher  8:45
"Yeah, yeah. Okay, so who should decide which we are experienced our good choice for child's kind of give some example"
Child  9:01
little kid like a five year old or whatever. They could get scared and then enjoy the headset when I am moving around so much.
Researcher  9:14
"Yeah, dad that question."
Child  9:18
Unless you have like a tight shroud.
Researcher  9:23
"Yeah. So how about like, older than five years old?"
Child  9:27

Child  10:03
When you're going on like vacations. You don't have to actually go on a vacation you can just be in VR.
Researcher  10:15
You talk something about like there are some application should be used for as for children some are not right. So who should decide which application should be used for the kids?
Child  10:25
"People that are going on it on the vocation. Like day kids, they tend to have an option if they want to or not."

So children and parents they both decide which one to use.
"When we make her create VR experience for children and family, what are some important things they should keep in mind?"
