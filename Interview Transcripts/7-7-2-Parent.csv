"So what did you think of the use of VR in these stories? I thought they were good in terms of, for children, they kind of, for the first one, for the education, it kind of brings them to a place where they wouldn't necessarily be able to, kind of give something different perspective on how to learn history and the world."
00:31:00
"And the second one with the medical ones, I like how it was used to kind of keep the kids' mind away from the situation they were in. It was used for comfort. That was cool. Is there other parts of these stories that stood out to you? No, not really."
00:59:00
"Can you? You know, I don't know if you, how can children and family use VR in positive ways? Or helpful way, or beneficial ways?"
01:12:00
I think it would be more...
01:19:00
"Yeah, I would say just for educational purposes. So if a kid has a question about some part of the world that they're not from, VR can make that happen. I see. That's the part that's kind of cool. What kind of problems might VR create for kids? I would say their tolerance to..."
01:49:00
the VR itself. I know sometimes even like the weight of the headset could be too much for a kid. Some kids might have be more prone to dizziness and so you can adjust like the tolerance so things aren't spinning around as fast. I mean that's the biggest thing I could see for a kid is just
02:17:00
"the tolerance level of movement within the VR. Oh, you mean tolerance of like, experience in that immersive experience. Yeah. Got it. Any other issues or problems?"
02:33:00
Is there maybe what are some situations in which VR should not be used?
02:40:00
I'm so sorry.
02:47:00
Holy
02:50:00
"If you're at home and it's kind of like you're on a phone visit with a doctor or if you're in a VR with the doctor you probably won't want to be diagnosed over VR. Oh, interesting. Okay. You still probably want to physically go in to see a doctor especially if..."
03:12:00
"I can't think of anything else. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for kids? Probably the parents. Parents, okay. Can you think of other examples that might be involved in making that decision? Or is it purely parents? I feel like it's mostly parents, yeah. So when creators design VR for children,"
03:39:00
"maybe for families, what important things should they keep in mind?"
03:46:00
"I would imagine different kids have different sensory levels. And so whether it's like they're more sensitive to light or sound or the movement, I know kids can be different in that way. So that would be something, just their sensory levels. Because I know as an adult, when I've played a..."
04:16:00
"a VR game that was way too fast, it kind of made me feel sick. And so I know that's my experience, but I would imagine if you're creating one experience for a group of kids where you find that median for tolerance for kids' sensory that's where I think would be a challenge in some of the work I'm doing."
04:42:00
"Can you think or provide other considerations? Is there other things that we should consider as well? Um, no, I don't think I can think of, yeah. Okay, one last question. Is there anything else that you want to tell us about VR for children and families that you thought of but didn't get your chance to talk about? Yeah, my only thing is I know most pediatricians we've dealt with, you know, they hate."
05:10:00
"They do recommend a limit of screen time for kids, whether it's TV or tablet device. And so I see VR headsets in that same category."
05:28:00
"of the kid and I'm sure it would range based on their age but how long could a third grader be on a VR headset? One hour a day? Three hours? I'm not sure. So you want the guidance of pediatrics to kind of say like what is the time limit? Yeah, yeah. To help you make that decision as a parent? Mm-hmm. I see. Okay. Yeah."
05:59:00
"Anything else? Nope. Well, thank you so much for your time. You've been like an anomaly. Awesome. Great help. Yeah, awesome."
