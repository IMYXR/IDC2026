So what did you think about the use of VR and the stories and what kind of stood out to?
Child  0:13
"Like, I think VR is pretty cool. You can like, you can't like see somebody who's like use VR to see them. Actually pretty cool."
Speaker 1  0:22
"Yeah, for sure. Was there anything about like the story specific? Was there anything about that and then stood up to?"
Child  0:33
"Like, kids usually just like, learn from like, videos, news, VR and stuff like that."
Speaker 1  0:41
What do you think are some benefits of using VR?
Speaker 2  0:49
I thinks you should only do like a limit of it.
Speaker 1  0:55
Do you think it can be good for people?
Child  0:58
A little bit
Speaker 1  0:59
a little bit? What are some ways that it can be good? What are some ways it can be bad?
Child  1:03
"Like, it can be good learning stuff. It can be bad, I'm getting a headache."
Speaker 1  1:07
For sure. Did you get a headache?
Child  1:10
Not. It's pretty actually fun.
Speaker 1  1:18
Can you think of any problems that VR can create for children?
Child  1:25
"like it could just like, like, or violence and stuff."
Speaker 1  1:28
Yeah. Do you want to elaborate on that?
Researcher 1:32
No. What do you think should decide which VR experiences are good for children appropriate?
Child  1:44
Parents. Because the parents won't want that kid watching long.
Researcher 1:54
"When all the people who create these VR experiences when they're creating them, what do you like so when the people who create these VR experiences. What do you think the people who create these things should keep in mind which they think."
Child  2:18
they should keep in mind that they need to make it a little shorter for the kids to take breaks?
Researcher 2:30
Is there a reason to take breaks in between? And then is there anything else that you want to tell me about VR about what your experience was using it yourself?
Child  2:46
Technology in schools? I don't think I have anything else.
Researcher 2:48
Nothing else. How was your experience?
Child  2:50
actually pretty good.
Speaker 1  2:51
Yeah. Did you have fun? Did you like be able to interact with your own the minute that's all I have.
