"So we would like to start by asking you what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts, if any, in these stories stood out to you? I thought it was interesting. I liked the part about the physical therapy where it was able to not focus on the theme. And then I also liked the part where they went to Monopoly. They played Monopoly together."

"How can children and families use VR in positive or helpful ways? Beneficial ways, yeah. It's a good way to travel long distances without physically traveling long distances. So you like that part? Yes. Okay. Anything else?"
00:50:00
"That's all I can think of right now. What kinds of problems might VR create for your children or families? It does create a little bit of isolation. Isolation? Can you just speak to that a little bit more? So like my kids might not be playing with each other or bonding together, but they're bonding with other kids. It may become a distraction for them to not interact with each other. Or a parent's to kids as well."
01:17:00
"Do you think that could be problematic? It could be, yes. Okay. What other... Is there anything else? Any other issues that you foresee?"
01:31:00
should not be used by kids? I don't think so. I think it's overall still a positive experience. Can you speak to that? What part? What can you help me understand? What positive? I think it's good to teach kids new technologies and so they can expand on it for their generation.
01:53:00
"or HVR experiences are suitable for kids? I think it should be a blend between the parents and the kids. The kids obviously know what they want to look at, but then the parents should have some input whether or not that's appropriate for them."
02:10:00
Anybody else that you can think of that might be involved in this decision making?
02:17:00
"I would say just the kids and the parents. Just kids and the parents, okay. So when designers and creators of VR experiences for kids"
02:27:00
"What are the things they should keep in mind? Excuse me. I would say putting limitations or expressing what the limitations are just based on age from the beginning. Because my son has a VR headset and then there's, he's eight, so he'll download a game but then he'll find out he has to be 13 to play it. So a lot of that stuff isn't clear from the beginning."
02:56:00
"So that's one area that we struggled with. So you want games and content tailored for his age? Yes. Okay. So when people design for that, is there something that they need to think about or consider for his age? So he's eight, and the one thing, it seems like a lot of the stuff geared for eight-year-olds is really geared for like five-year-olds. I see. So it seems like..."
03:24:00
"whatever age they're tailored for, it's behind. Okay, so what do you think is suitable for his age group? Like Minecraft, Roblox, that type of, those types of games. I'm not extremely familiar with them, so. You're not? No. Oh, I see, I see, okay. Is there anything else that you wanna tell us about VR for kids or for your kids?"
03:50:00
"No, I think it's just great. It's always good to see new technology come out and how we can expand on it. So for your child there's no issues of them using VR at home? No. No problems except the content? Yeah. But yeah, he really likes it overall. I'd say it's positive. Awesome. Anything else? Nope. Okay, thank you so much."
