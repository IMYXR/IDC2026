"Okay, I made that mistake. That was. So the first question, what did you think about us off we are in this story."
Speaker 1  0:08
"I thought they were mostly appropriate. I don't like the idea of always being separated, or in a classroom setting. There's a lot to be done in person. But then in the last one, having everyone together and doing like, the field trips"
Qiao Jin  0:25
"together and use. Okay. So, are there any other benefits you say about using the app? Okay. For what? Using the app? Okay. Is there any added benefit benefits?"
Speaker 1  0:38
"Oh, I, I mean, I think it's going to be the next large step, technologically. So I don't know what it's going to be used for. But I'm sure it's going to be used in many different facets of life. And we're only at the beginning of it. So"
Qiao Jin  0:52
"yeah. So what kinds of issues or problems you see about using VR,"
Speaker 1  0:58
"I think, with kids, like strain on the eyes, and just kind of like disconnecting from reality. And so I think just continued use might be a little too much. Yeah. So I think figuring out at what age is best to start that or what the level is where you can and can't use it, where it's recommended, and that I think that's gonna be"
Qiao Jin  1:20
"really cool, too. So in order to fix that issue, like to find the appropriate children's age, high kosher, the while we're in this process to decide which we are experiencing. Right. So I do kind of think of some stakeholders."
Speaker 1  1:39
"I don't know it's a tough one. Yeah. It opens a whole new can of worms, like who's going to be involved in everything now? So? Yeah, that's tough. I don't know the answer to that."
Qiao Jin  1:52
"To some extent, I know, like I mentioned the parents for the involving the decision. And teachers, or maybe if you are using the healthcare like to talk personally to decide which country?"
Speaker 1  2:02
"Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, for the children, obviously, the parents have to be involved in some way, shape, or form. But then I feel like you'd need a lot more of these types of studies. And then also on the clinical side of things and how it affects development and stuff like that. So I think there's a whole lot of research to be done here. Yeah."
Qiao Jin  2:23
"Yeah. So when creator design, we are applications, or we are hardware for case, do you have to think? Can you imagine something important? They should keep in mind?"
Speaker 1  2:35
"To use them for? Yeah. I think I think a lot of it will be used for educational settings. Oh,"
Qiao Jin  2:42
"yeah. I mean, like, if the we are creators want to design some VR hardware or software. Okay. Do you have some suggestions? Like you want to give them some reminders about the autonomy important sense, you should keep in mind,"
Speaker 1  2:57
"I think the best thing in classrooms will be to give out like the one video showed, like going to different locations. And making it like, to that period of time. I think there's a lot of benefit in that and showing the differences between what was and what is so why"
Qiao Jin  3:15
makers should provide more options that allow them to access different locations. Yes.
Speaker 1  3:21
And the ability and the ease of switching around I think as well.
Qiao Jin  3:25
So is there anything else you want to tell me about how kids use VR? I assume right
Speaker 1  3:30
now it's gonna it'll be a lot for video games.
Qiao Jin  3:34
"BioMart about I'm addicted to the hardware,"
Unknown Speaker  3:38
but we don't have a at our house yet. So
Qiao Jin  3:41
I plan to buy it.
Speaker 1  3:44
"No, my my son will be the one that's more interested. He's a he's not here. But her maybe him definitely would enjoy it. But I worried about that. Yeah,"
Qiao Jin  3:54
"because we haven't have a very comprehensive guideline about how kids, I don't know"
Speaker 1  4:00
"how Yeah, how it's gonna affect them just like physically. And then just emotionally and mentally, like, can we process all that? Seeing it? As it's real?"
Qiao Jin  4:08
"I don't know. Yeah, yeah. There's so much reading there."
