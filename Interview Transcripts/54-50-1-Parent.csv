"What did you think about the use of VR in these stories? And what part of these stories stood out to you? Both the family and the health context? Yeah, I think the part that stood out to me was the family. It seemed very segmented, the people were doing their own thing and weren't really connecting with one another. But I could see where there was beneficial use, like in the doctor's office. Or in the instance where the child was..."

"in a hospital for some period of time. He was able to use the VR to connect with friends while he was still not really there, but still connecting with them. Is there any other beneficial uses for kids and family? How can kids and family use VR in positive ways or helpful ways? Maybe if there was more together, maybe they were doing things as a family,"
00:57:00
"virtual VR worlds I guess. But I think if they're doing things more together, then I think there would be more connection to one another. What kind of problems or issue might VR create for your kids or for kids and families in general?"
01:12:00
"I think it's just another avenue of additional screen time. I think there's a lot out there already. And it just creates one more piece for them to go to. Can you tell me a little bit more? What is the issues with screen time? Well, there's just so much out there between phones, TVs, computers at school. There's just so much screen time already. I feel like it's kind of a crutch for kids not to go out and experience things."
01:40:00
in person or in real life and more of a they want to experience it through a screen. How is that problematic in your opinion? In my opinion because you're not getting the real life experience of actually being hands-on and doing it. And that could impact them? I feel like it could. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Who should? I think that's up to parents.
02:11:00
"I think that's kind of up to each individual parent group. Anybody else that you think that might be involved in the decision making? I guess if they consulted with their doctors maybe in a certain way. Doctors? Why doctors? I don't know, I guess it depends on the type of doctor. I guess not every doctor is the same. So they seem to have their best interests for the most part would be my thought. Okay."
02:42:00
"When creators design VR for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind? Or what things that they need to be considering? You know, again, I think just more of the how to get everybody involved maybe in the same place, doing the same thing versus kind of their own segmented world. Not creating separation in the family. I think maybe doing things that are more together versus in separate places. Anything else?"
03:12:00
"No. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about VR for families and kids that we didn't ask about? I don't think so. We have very limited experience with it so I can't add a lot there. But you kind of draw parallels between that and screen time and wanted to ask a little bit more about VR. Yeah, only because our kids have had a VR set at one point and it's, you know, it's"
03:41:00
"It seemed as if they, again, it was just one more thing for them to want to go do versus actually being out, being with friends or being outside and doing things. And it was just one more thing for them to be attracted to, but not experiencing things kind of outside. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you. Take care."
