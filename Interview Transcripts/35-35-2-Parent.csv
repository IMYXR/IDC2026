"Okay, so now we want to ask you some questions about your insights about using VR. So what do you think about us we are in the stories, you choose to scenarios and you can like specify which story make you stood stood out to you?"
Speaker 1  6:20
"I don't like the idea of the VR classroom like fully immersed. I think it takes away from learning about people and social interactions in a real way. Yeah, I don't like it. I did not like that scenario. As far as the medical stuff, like using the device, in the second scenario to forget about your pain and not improve is not necessarily a good thing all the time. But in small doses, I think that can be a good thing."
Researcher  7:01
"Okay, so how can children and families use VR in positive and help always? How can children and family use VR in positive ways?"
Speaker 1  7:15
"I think when there's distance, it can be a positive thing to share experiences with people that don't necessarily live in your home. I still prefer real socialization over a VR situation. But yeah,"
Researcher  7:32
"because it is still like not real as Yeah. Okay, so what kind of issue or problems  VR create for your child."
Unknown Speaker  7:47
"kind of visual problems,"
Researcher  7:50
"as you mentioned, there is motion sickness."
Speaker 1  7:52
"Yeah, I, personally, I would get motion sickness very easily as why I don't play video games. But I think just being able to legitimately touch and feel and move around more freely without the VR is a much better thing than having that VR not knowing what's around you in reality is a bad thing. The idea of some situations in which we are shown not to never be used. Driving. "
Researcher  8:18
"Yeah, like considering the dangers no hunting. Yeah, that totally makes sense. So who should decide which we are experienced as suitable for child? Who should choose? Yeah, who should decide like this is a good option, or this is a good, good, bad option?"
Speaker 1  8:51
"I mean, ultimately, parents should get to decide. But I think educators definitely have a place in bringing forth information about how it could be a good thing."
Researcher  9:02
"Yeah, so as a parent, so what types of like guidance you want to make for your child? Like if they want to use VR?"
Speaker 1  9:09
"No.I think there's a time and a place for it. I don't want him fully immersed in that kind of world. We don't allow a whole lot of video games at home or anything like that, as it is so"
Researcher  9:24
"like, set up some screen time."
Yeah.
"I see. So when creators design VR for kids and family, what important things to think keeping in mind."
Speaker 1  9:36
"I think there needs to be something to keep them physically active involved. Just being stationary. You know, I know that. Some of that exists, but I don't like the idea of him just sitting on the couch. And yeah, getting immersed in not moving physically becoming sedentary."
Researcher  9:56
"Yeah, that's it. So is there anything else you want to tell me about the VR for family?"
Speaker 3  10:04
I've gotten nothing
