"Awesome. So thinking about either the context of at home or education that you just watched, what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? I thought that they were both really cool. In her school, she goes to in-person school. Already they do virtual field trips through whatever, like visiting the website. So I think actually adding the virtual component would be really cool."
00:29:00
"kind of cool and bring them more into it. And like I remember like during COVID, like we did something similar where like we sent board games to her friends and set up video calls for them to be able to play games, you know, from a distance with each other. So it's not too far different from things that we've already done. I think."
00:54:00
"If I was concerned about anything, it would be like, who has access to it? How are they using it safely? Protecting their data? Especially the one where the kid was in school for the full day on the VR. What would that do to his eyesight? Day in and day out using it. And then she has a cousin who does online school."
01:20:00
"and he had difficulties with using the equipment appropriately outside of school, so that would also, I think, be a concern. Oh, I see, okay. Is there other parts in these stories that stood out to you? Um..."
01:35:00
"I just thought that they, like overall it's a really good idea. I liked the idea of the club and using it kind of more in limited circumstances versus the full day. And again, like at home using it for specific purposes the whole time. I noticed that it said the mom tried many times to call the family to dinner and that kind of rings true because when she is on."
02:02:00
"video games or anything like that at home. Sometimes it's hard to bring her back. So I wonder if that might also be an issue. I mean, I'm just gonna, you kind of mentioned it, but I want to specifically get that question on record. How can children and families use VR in maybe positive or helpful ways? Well, the connection aspect is a huge one. When COVID was separating everyone, having something where you could feel like you were more."
02:32:00
connected and together would be good. And we have family that lives like overseas and you know across the country. It would be nice to kind of have more of a connection with them. I think that's probably the biggest way that I can see. But also having like more of like almost that hands-on experience with like schools and field trips and things like that.
02:58:00
"I know that you kind of mentioned some of the issues that you foresaw, but can you think of other kinds of problems that VR might create for children and families that you haven't mentioned? I mentioned the vision, being concerned about that, and the privacy and safety issues in the classroom. It was really disorienting for me to be in that world and then take it off and be right back here. So I could see, you know..."
03:27:00
"like that and injuring yourself. I don't know if that's ridiculous but that's something that I can see myself doing. Right, right. And other than that, just me getting sure the scenario is a safe one. You never know, you go on Roblox and there are people there who are trying to distract children in negative ways."
03:56:00
"Hopefully schools would have a way of preventing that, but I just want to know more. The whole day school is kind of throwing me off a little bit on there. "
Can you think of other or certain situations in which VR should not be used? 
It just feels like that's a little bit much. Too much time sitting there. It kind of reminds me of WALL-E where they're in those chairs and never moved.
04:25:00
"Yeah, I guess that's the one that's kind of thrown at me. Wally, the pics are animated."
" Yeah. Okay, cool. Wanna make sure we're talking about the same Wally? Absolutely. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? "
"I think the parents should be the final decision makers, but I mean obviously schools should think about it and talk about what would work best for those environments and then the parents can kind of weigh in from there."
04:55:00
"their kids to do it, then they don't have to sign up for that program, if that makes sense. Anybody else that you think that should be involved in the making of this decision, besides parents and schools? I mean..."
05:11:00
"Well, like I said, I'd be concerned about vision and things like that, so maybe getting opinions from doctors to understand what's the long term or what's the effects that could happen. So when creators design VR for kids and family, what important things they should keep in mind?"
05:34:00
"and safety controls, making sure that it's like a secure network so that strangers aren't coming on there or, you know, protecting kids from like their contacts with it. There's a lot of creepy people in the world. Right, right. So I think that would be like a major concern for me. Like privacy and data also, but... What type of data are you picking?"
05:59:00
"I don't know what would necessarily be required to participate in those kind of things, but I'm imagining it. That's so cool! Look at that! It can snap around your arm. I would think that maybe some kind of biometrics or something like that would be necessary to keep track of, and I'd be concerned how in-depth is that information. I see. And do you think safety should also have physical safety as well? Yeah, yeah."
06:28:00
"Physical safety is the location safe for them to do it in. The club looked like a great idea because they're kind of in a set place that looked like. But the one where the kid was in it for all day is at his house. It said that he's doing physical activities. I don't know, is he running around a track? But actually it's something in his way. I don't know."
06:53:00
Is there any other specific examples that you can think of for these explorations?
07:01:00
off the top of my head. Anything else that you want to tell us after watching these stories or the experience of VR that we should consider for families and kids? Maybe making it affordable. I know our school has a lot of Title IX children and lower income.
07:26:00
"So I guess making sure that access is still possible. Yeah, so it works financially and also, Yeah. Just yeah, like having this place be awesome. Anything else? Not that I can think of. Awesome, thank you so much. This was really wonderful."
