"We're just going to record our answers so that we don't miss anything. So the very first question is, what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of the stories stood out to you?"
Child  0:14
"So in the school one, I think it was positive. Like, it helps them learn. And if they're like homeschooled, it could really help them, like, make friends and stuff. And at home, one of the ways was like, to play with their friends to watch hockey games, and like, do that. I think that could cause some problems. Because the family like isn't spending enough time together. They're all like, separated and doing their own thing. But at the same time, it could help because they're doing what they like, and they can find out what they like."
Researcher  1:00
"Yeah. So what kinds of problems might VR create for you as a pit? And can you give some examples? I know you mentioned soft, but specifically for you."
Child  1:08
"Um, like, there's, you're not spending a lot of time with your parents and brothers and siblings."
Researcher  1:19
"And can you expand on that a little bit? Like how might using VR make it so that you don't spend enough time with your family, um,"
Child  1:25
"You might just be up in your room or sitting on the couch just on your VR, while others wait might be on their VR. And you're like, a way you could be like playing with your friends, but you're not actually like going to their house and running productive. You're just like, kind of being lazy and sitting on the couch."
Speaker 0  1:45
Yeah. And who do you think should decide which VR experiences are a good choice for children?
Child  1:53
The parents.
Researcher  1:54
"Right, and are there like people but then like, your current use of electronic at home? Are there people in your life like adults in your life that make rules or decisions? Yeah. Like, who are those people? And what do you feel about? Like, how do you feel about"
Child  2:08
"my mom and dad, and I think they make the decisions for my mental health and how I grow up."
Researcher  2:16
"Right, great. And then when we are makers, create VR experiences for children and families, what are some important things that these makers should keep in mind?"
Child  2:28
"They should make sure that it doesn't like swear a lot, that it's family friendly. And isn't that inappropriate?"
Researcher  2:36
Right. Yeah. And is there anything about how the headset actually is like physically isn't comfortable for you? Other things that they should keep in mind about how it physically is?
Child  2:47
"I really like how it's like, padded around the face, so that it's comfortable, and it's not like plastic digging in your face, right? And the straps are really comfortable, kind of out of like foamy plastic. But I don't really like is like the way to hold the handle. The circles on the top kind of make, it's like it's kind of hard to move your wrists around. But I think it's a good design."
Researcher  3:17
Yeah. Okay. Is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for families?
Unknown Speaker  3:23
I think it's a really cool idea.
Speaker 0  3:25
"Okay, great. Thank you."
