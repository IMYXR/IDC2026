We're going to start by asking you what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of these stories stood out to you? Sure. You get to choose a context whether I think you watch it at home or at school.
00:15:00
"I think the part that was missing was, is there a benefit over just virtual learning using VR? So like the comparison of one versus the other, does that make sense? Can you tell me a little bit more? Yeah, sure. I mean, like video conferencing versus VR. Like is there a benefit to one over the other? The context of the questions were really like, do you feel like this is acceptable for your kids?"
00:44:00
"benefit? Yes, is it a benefit over, you know, nothing? Of course, yes. But is it a benefit over traditional video conferencing? I don't know. I think that's an outstanding question in my mind. I don't know that there is a benefit to it, truly. I see, okay. Maybe in the context of like, you know, mentioning benefits of using VR, how can children and family use VR in positive or helpful ways? Sure, I think..."
01:15:00
"I guess I'd have to probably think about it a little more, but maybe like things that are more..."
01:23:00
"spatially, the context is more spatial, like national parks or something might benefit to something like that. Like if you could view that through VR versus a..."
01:40:00
video or something. So the immersive experience? Yeah. In certain context. So what kinds of problems might be are great for your children or children and family in general?
01:56:00
"I guess we haven't used it enough to fully understand that. I mean, I think anytime you sort of like take yourself out of like, you know, generally your space, a little concerning. Okay. Just can you give me, you know, speak a little bit more to that. Sure. Yeah. Do you have kids? You know..."
02:19:00
"If they watch TV, they get sort of zoned into the TV, right? And so if you take a step further and even remove them from the sort of overall, I don't know how to describe that exactly, but you know, just the family sphere, right? And now they're like totally zoned in. They have earbuds in, they have the VR, they're like totally in their own world, right? I don't know."
02:47:00
"It's a little concerning I guess. Okay, you're talking about transition? Or are you talking about basically being completely immersed in that environment? Yeah, I mean like completely immersed where they're like totally separated. Got it. Yeah. Okay, so the disconnect growing up, their surroundings or their family or? Yeah, and I'll say I don't have experience with it, so I don't know if it's a problem or not, but I could see it being a problem. Based on other... Sure, yeah. Yeah, okay."
03:15:00
"What is some situation in which VR should not be used, in your opinion? Oh, I don't know if I have a strong enough opinion to say this is not acceptable. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Or a good choice, you know? I mean, I think ultimately it would be up to the parents. Parents, okay. Sure. Anybody else that you think that should be involved in making this decision?"
03:44:00
"I mean, I think it stops with the parents, ultimately, but if the school is like, hey, we want to provide this experience to the kids, that's sort of on the school."
03:58:00
Parents can decide if they want to accept that or not. So parents should be asked.
04:08:00
"I mean, ultimately parents have the control. They could take their kids out of the school if they feel strongly enough to not accept that. So when creators design VR for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind?"
04:29:00
"I guess I'm just not that experienced with it to provide a... You know, for you to make that decision to use VR for your family. What things that you would want to know."
04:43:00
designers to keep in mind.
04:55:00
"I guess making it kid friendly, right? I don't know. I guess, again, I don't have enough experience with VR to really say, could she put on a VR headset without me helping her, you know, guide her through it? I don't know. Yeah. And could she get herself into trouble with it? You know, the Internet is a very, like, vast..."
05:21:00
"not experienced with it as in little kids you can get yourself into trouble pretty quick so without parental guidance. So you want like safety? Yeah sure. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about VR for kids and families that you didn't get the chance to talk about? I guess not. No this is great, thank you so much, it was really helpful."
