"You start recording just in case I didn't miss anything instead. So you'll choose the education and the house area. Right? So what did you think about the use of VR in the stories? What did you think about the use of VR in these stories,"
Speaker 1  0:16
I liked the the idea of using it to kind of calm kids who are in stressful imaging scenarios. That seemed like a good use of it. I'm really very skeptical of like virtual spaces for education.
Qiao Jin  0:32
So all school Dali we are using the
Speaker 1  0:35
"future was kind of cool, you know, and there's definitely like things that could be used for. But the idea that like, you would not have school in person, and instead just be online, I don't, I don't see the benefit to that. Barring like somebody in a very remote environment, like I grew up in a very rural area, and I took AP classes, like a closed circuit TV with other schools, because we didn't have enough teachers and students in our school to do them. Although I don't know why that's listening. Well, you know, an AP English lecture in VR isn't any better than listening to it with headphones on the screen? With a teacher, I don't even immersive calculus experiment, you know. So I'm skeptical of the VR benefits over standard traditional like AV stuff."
Qiao Jin  1:22
"Yeah. So what kinds of issues or problems might we equate for kids and family? So what kinds of issues or problems might we create for our kids? And I know you already mentioned some of this, but others, like,"
Speaker 1  1:38
"like, video with a kid playing too many games and are doing his work, like, let's do that with anything they can find, you know, like, boys, books, comics, whatever, they'll find something else to do if they don't want to do the thing. So I don't think that's a VR problem. I worry about some of that. Like, especially like long term, like the school setting, like whether there will be VR or vision health issues. I don't know what we really know about how children's VR interacts with long term use of that. I think you've probably seen up ticking pinkeye. It's much closer than general digital devices. But it's just another tool. It's another thing, guys,"
Qiao Jin  2:15
so who should decide which we are experienced as suitable for kids? Parents or school? Green?
Speaker 1  2:24
"It's, again, I don't think it's different for VR than anything else. Right? So some of"
Qiao Jin  2:28
"that is like smartphone, or,"
Speaker 1  2:31
"you know, what medical procedures are appropriate? Or what movies are they allowed to see or whatever. Like, sometimes that's an apparent thing. And should be, sometimes that's, you know, educators crafting curriculums. Sometimes doctors have to make calls about what they need to do or what makes sense. I don't see you making VR changes on occasion at"
Qiao Jin  2:50
"all. Yeah. Would you approach your child to use it individually? Or you think they should have an accountant? Like, would you allow your child to use VR individually? Are you think there should have a childhood inside visit?"
Speaker 1  3:03
"I don't. Again, that's kind of like any other like, online like if it was purely disconnected, like, put the video on watch a movie, or put the video on like Squarespace played beat Sabre or whatever. Sure. Cool. It's like a big interactive VR chat room kind of thing. And I'd have the same concerns I'd have about any other non VR internet. Like, yeah, it sounds. So I don't think it being VR makes a big difference there for me."
Qiao Jin  3:30
"Gotcha. So when creator design we are for kids, do you have any suggestions for them? Or like, Are there something important that you think they should keep in mind?"
Speaker 1  3:43
"So I work in tech. Yeah. Well, my first exposure to doozy is around VR was before you were born. Oh, wow. I remember being at like a Disney VR thing in like 1999. So every time I see one of these, like booms and bust cycles of technology, like, it's really about picking out what the actual capabilities are, and what you could actually do with it, you couldn't do with the other tools you have. And then leveraging those. So like, replacing calculus lecture on a screen or in person with a VR coffee doesn't add anything. Some of the stuff where like, people are visual learners, it's really interesting to be able to, like explore space, or maybe like, there's a difference between, like seeing a picture of the Parthenon, and like the old Explorer, and there are places you couldn't go and explore and see that you could, like so like, you can't actually take all the kids to the waste management plan and let them like, go look at how the actual like, I don't know, always action plans work. But like, it's hard to do that. But you could give them a VR tour of that and then they can understand how that would work. Yeah, um, So I have with a musical watch a video or something like this where it's, it's not interactive and it doesn't really it's just a big movie like have like an omni theater almost as an adult in my mind. Yeah,"
Qiao Jin  5:11
"yeah. So is there anything else you want to tell me about? We are using this okay? I don't think so. Okay, that's great."
