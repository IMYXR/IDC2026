"So could you please tell us what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and if there is any parts that stood out to you? Having a child with special needs, being focused on one thing and one thing only and the effect that video games have on you, I don't think it would be a good idea to do it in certain situations."
00:25:00
"But in other cases, like at the doctor, where she was getting an MRI, I think that's a great idea and a great distraction. So you said you have a child who is? Special needs. Which is, he's what? 11. He's 11, he's hard of hearing? Deaf, hard of hearing, fetal, whole bunch of other things.  So you will know how hard would he immersed in the VR. I see, so what, can you explain, tell me more, a little bit, I'm sorry, I don't know the context of why do you see, specifically for that child to be a problem? Because..."

"He also has obsessive compulsive disorder, so he would get too wrapped up in the game or whatever it is he would be doing. So it would be like the one scenario, he was at the home and instead of going to dinner he was playing the game and that's what he would do. So he would be too focused on the game and the virtual reality stuff as opposed to taking care of what needs to be done."
01:20:00
"So you foresee some, creating some tensions and problems around tasks and... I see, okay. So thinking about, you know, you said earlier the benefits around, like I can foresee some benefits, right? Can you, you know, how can children and families use VR in beneficial ways or positive ways, or helpful ways? I think in that way."
01:44:00
"Both of those videos that I watched where they went to the museum, I think that's cool because that's not something you might not be able to get to do otherwise unless you go somewhere in person. So to be able to sit in a classroom and go to a museum and see stuff like that that you won't be able to see otherwise, I think that's very beneficial. And then as well as when she was getting her MRI or CAT scan or whatever she was getting."
02:06:00
"having that distraction where she's not focused on the loud noise in the closed area. She's focused on something completely different. I think that's very beneficial to me. I see. Okay, so kind of getting back to some of the issues or problems in the context of all children's, right? Specifically, you know, it's great that you have a specific case, but what kinds of problems might they are create for children? I think it's just a distraction thing. Like they did the classroom thing"
02:35:00
"much, I'm more in person so it's harder for me to comprehend who's in this in a classroom or sitting at home to do homework or whatever as opposed to in person. It's similar to like doing during COVID when there was the"
02:58:00
"Where it was all virtual, the computer and all that stuff, and how it affected kids in general as opposed to in the classroom. So that would be my concern is that. Okay. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Parents. Parents? Okay. Anybody else? No. Okay."
03:28:00
"Okay, when creators design VR for kids and families, what important things they should keep in mind?"
03:41:00
"um... Lana, Lana, Lana!"
03:47:00
"content of what is on the VR. So, like I said, the museum or educational stuff, I think is very beneficial as opposed to just random games or whatever. That makes sense. Yeah. Anything else? No? OK. Well, thank you so much."
