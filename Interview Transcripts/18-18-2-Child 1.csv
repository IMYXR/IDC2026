Child  0:22
It might be addicted but it might be good.
Researcher  0:23
What about you?
Speaker 2  0:29
"I feel like it's a good idea to like, use VR, but not like, like, at your home, like actually, like learn in school. And like, I think you'll do pretty good idea that you so much for like, going back to like, look at dinosaurs and stuff if you can't do that. So that would be cool. But at the same time, you don't want to be, like, the whole point of school is kind of like learn through doing."

"Yeah, well, you said earlier how like kids might get addicted. You want to talk about that a little bit more."

I get addicted sometimes. So it's kind of hard to get off the game. VR can be argued off to spend a lot of time on it.

The teachers or your parents.

"Like VR has games that are like bad, like, scary, like, amazing. It was also like that to help people to learn."
Researcher  2:21
"And then when the people who create all these different types of experiences when they create it, what should they keep in mind specifically, like for kids?"
Speaker 2  2:37
"Make sure that all ages can do it. And make sure that like, this would be like a pair of control things so that way people can actually take charge of it."
Researcher  2:45
"Yeah, for sure. Um, with your both of your individual experiences with a VR headset. How like, how was that? Do you have any feedback? How was it?"
Child  2:55
"I think it was good. it's really fun to see like, how like actual astronauts thought they saw. Also the dinosaurs."
