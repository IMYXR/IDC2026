this part only for data analysis. So I'm going to start with asking you what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what part of these stories stood out to you in the context of I think you really do watch at home and education or school.

"The first video was good, and then the second one, I noticed that families were more distant from each other. And then that's really what I don't like at home. Everyone on their phones. I like bonding times. I feel like VR would be like, I don't know, it affects families, bonding times. And anything else that stood out to you? Other context?"
00:44:00
"So how can children and family use VR in positive or helpful ways? I guess there's one about school, how they did virtual looking at places. So that was pretty nice. Something else, the science part of it, that'd be beneficial, especially with COVID and how some families are scared of going out. That'd be good."
01:14:00
"How about what kind of problems or issues might VR create for your children, children, or families? I'd just say the same thing. Getting families to be more different from each other and not really having bonding times because they're going to want to be on their VR. What else can you anticipate or see? These type of content are good. If they're more, I don't know..."
01:40:00
"Some with weapons or whatever. I'd be like more against it, because I don't know. So the content? Yeah, it depends all on the content. So this one was pretty good. What else? Like in general, like the access to different contact for kids that could be concerning, yeah? Yeah? I don't know. OK. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Like, you know, who should decide that these are good choices for kids or not?"
02:10:00
"I would like people in education, family members. Family members? Yeah. You mean like parents? Parents, yeah. Anybody else that you think should be involved in making this decision? It's going to sound kind of weird, but probably psychiatrists maybe? I don't know. Why does it sound weird? Tell me more. Maybe like, I don't know, weapons is something big for kids."
02:35:00
"But it all depends on the context and that way they have seen children and they can connect and be like, oh this is probably not good. So you want an assessment basically for a medical to see. Yeah."
"R: Okay. Is there anything else that you want to tell us? Oh sorry, there's another question. When creating VR experiences for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind?"
03:05:00
the content. Anything else?
R: No. This is the content. Okay. And the content is just for safety and safety. Yeah. Yeah. Is there anything else that you want to tell us about the VR for kids and families that you thought of but we didn't talk about? No. No? That's pretty good. Thank you so much. That was really helpful.
