"Okay, so you have interesting the education and family area, like using big scenario. So what did you think about the use of we are in this story,"
Speaker 1  0:11
"I thought it was like good, like when they use it in like, definitely an educational way when like, you can't go places and stuff like, but it can, like you can still connect with people. But like the one I didn't really like, as much as like when the kid like went to school in VR, I think it would be like, good to like, still, like, have some human interaction and like, without, you know, the headset on and everything, but I do think it would be beneficial and like, especially with like, the whole COVID thing, like that could have been really like a good potential if we had that kind of technology. Yeah, like, I also do think like human interactions also really good to like, in person."
Qiao Jin  0:47
"So what kinds of issues or problems might we operate for? Okay,"
Speaker 1  0:51
"so like to, like, create, like, social distancing? In a way, kind of because or, like, also stereo screen, kind of like, You mean, like isolated phones? Yeah. And like, whatever, all the whatever the screen like that could affect your eyes and stuff. So like that kind of issue. So"
Qiao Jin  1:11
there are some situations you may be asked will not be used?
Speaker 1  1:14
"Yeah, I definitely think there's some areas that it shouldn't be used. But like, I would say it shouldn't be used if it's not necessarily necessary. But like, so like, for like, for, like the educational ones where they went? Like, it was like a field trip, like across the country, right? It would be cool to like, learn about that stuff without having to physically travel that far, because that's expensive and everything. Yep. But like, I don't think they need to necessarily do that. If it's like, another classroom in their building."
Qiao Jin  1:44
"Like I do already have some other alternatives technology. Yep. Got it. So who shall decide which we are experienced as to talk, okay, what who should decide which we are experienced as to form okay."
Speaker 1  1:59
"I think it should be like, discuss, like with the parents and like schools if they're doing it, but like, I think in a way like the kids could decide to they're interested in."
Qiao Jin  2:08
"So if they already have the VR headset do allows them to use it individually, like using your shoes. They can do this by themselves. Yep. Okay. So can you imagine any other stakeholders visually to to use the app? Okay."
Speaker 1  2:27
"I think it would like be beneficial for them to like, like, especially like people that don't travel very often just like to see different places like you could like, do it like for national parks and stuff. I don't want to be like the same experience, but like, it would be cool for them to like, experience different places around the world and stuff. That would be cool."
Qiao Jin  2:44
"Oh, gotcha. So when creators design VR for kids, and families, what important things you should should they keep in mind?"
Speaker 1  2:51
"I think they should keep in mind like, keep it like, not necessarily like, all games, right? Like, I think they respond in certain games. That wouldn't be cool. But I also think like, in a way can be used educationally and like, not so much like just so it's like for fun, but also fun that you can like learn something from and like, also"
Qiao Jin  3:12
choose which content. So is there anything else you want to tell me about we are for kids or family?
Speaker 1  3:20
"Oh, I think it's I think it's a good technology and just like you know, a new technology. A lot of parents aren't used to taking mom's water. Okay, we're almost done. Yeah, we're done."
