So the first one is what did you think about the use of VR in stories?
Speaker 1  0:06
"Um, I could see its pros and some cons. I think the biggest the biggest concern I had in the videos I watched was when everyone kind of went separated and kept isolated in their, like specific areas of interest."
Researcher  0:27
"So in the family situation, yeah, yeah. So what's the pros, you'll say?"
Speaker 1  0:35
"They all identify a community that they can relate to. Being able to connect with people that are in geographic, different locations, geographically would be a pro."
Researcher  0:51
"Yep, that makes sense. So what are some situations in which we are should never be used should never be used? ."
Speaker 2  1:01
"Oh, gosh, like, you know, recommend your violence."
Researcher  1:09
Like the content not appropriate.
Okay. Right. Right.
Speaker 1  1:16
"Yeah, I don't know, even with young girls and beauty standards, I think that's a dangerous."
Researcher  1:23
That's a good point. Yeah.
Unknown Speaker  1:25
So I think violence would be my biggest concern.
Researcher  1:31
So who should decide which VR experienced are suitable for kids? Like to solve this?
Speaker 1  1:36
"Well, I would generally say the parents should. But that's a loaded statement, too. Because I don't know that all parents are equipped with good decision making skills."
Researcher  1:49
"Yeah, yeah. That's right. So you're saying someone should, for example, give parents some guidance or trainings before they actually use it."
"Absolutely, yeah. So when creator design we are for kids and families, what important things they should keep in mind."
Speaker 1  2:10
"I think the most important thing is to just acknowledge that their brains are actively developing. And so we should focus on what would provide or enhance proper development. Yeah, it can be entertaining and, and provide proper development, I think, or educational, you know, entertaining and educational can go hand in hand."
Researcher  2:36
Yeah. So we are makers could also connect to the teachers and parents to like co-design. So yeah. That's good. So are there anything else you want to tell me about using VR for kids?
Unknown Speaker  2:47
"Oh, my kids are interested in it. So"
Researcher  2:50
"yeah, I felt like they are more interested about the social part."
Speaker 1  2:52
"Yeah. And I've been just a little hesitant to just say, oh, have at it, but I think that, like any technology, if used well, It has awesome implications for the future."
Researcher  3:07
Yeah. Thank you.
