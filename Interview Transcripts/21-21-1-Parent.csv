"You choose the education and family area, right? What did you think about the use of VR in the stories?"
Speaker 1  0:14
"I thought it was fine when they were using it in small adults. But when it was replacing human interaction for like extensive periods of time, I don't like it."
Qiao Jin  0:26
So do you see any benefits? Like for kids to use in the ER?
Speaker 1  0:30
"Yeah, I mean, especially like kids that are isolated are in like small towns and want to see things like like the space station, or like, the dinosaurs or whatever, for like, a 30 minute lesson or something, or seeing family that's far away stuff like that."
Qiao Jin  0:50
Gotcha. So I there's some issues or problems you'll see of using VR?
Speaker 1  0:55
"Because it's like, you don't actually communicate it...."
Qiao Jin  0:59
"It's not a real, like, physical interaction."
Speaker 1  1:03
"And it's not.... I'm a teacher, and I already see just from Covid, from kids distance learning for not even a year, most of them, like, the social interaction is so impaired. So I can only imagine like, if this was how,"
Qiao Jin  1:18
"yeah, like, if we use we are in class, like for teacher, it's also challenges to manage all this?"
Speaker 1  1:26
"I wouldn't, my kids wouldn't use it. But yeah, I mean, it's just gonna impair, like, the ability to actually like, look someone in the eye or use body language or just different"
Qiao Jin  1:38
stuff like that. That doesn't make sense. So who should decide which we are experienced as suitable for kids?
Speaker 1  1:47
"Experts on kids, so like,"
Qiao Jin  1:51
"what, like, what types of experts?"
Speaker 1  1:55
"Like, like childhood experts not be our experts. educators and parents are not like tech people, like childhood experts."
Qiao Jin  2:08
So child experts can give some guidelines like how....
Speaker 1  2:13
"The teaching assisstants, teachers, child psychologist and VR designers or whatever."
Qiao Jin  2:22
"Yeah, that make senses. So we created VR for kids and families, what important thing that you think they should keep in mind"
Speaker 1  2:36
"I don't know, make it short. Like,"
Qiao Jin  2:41
Not too long...
Speaker 1  2:45
And make sure they can communicate like through it. It's not so that it's not so isolating.
Qiao Jin  2:54
Maybe we have some like better Motion Tracking system.
Speaker 1  2:58
Yeah. I don't know what else.
Qiao Jin  3:02
"Yeah, that's good. So is there anything else you want to tell me about user VR? Okay."
Speaker 1  3:08
No
Qiao Jin  3:09
okay. That's already great. Very happy. Thank you so much.
