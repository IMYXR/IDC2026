"So we're going to start by asking you what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? What parts of these stories stood out to you the most in the context of families and the doctor? Oh, the one that was at the doctor? And at the time, either, you could call it. Oh, either. So my biggest concern was the all virtual reality school."
00:21:00
"I really like the idea of using virtual reality to explore a museum or any part. You can go inside the human body with virtual reality. But I don't like the idea of isolation, doing it only from your bedroom. Not having the other social interaction with people was my biggest concern there. I thought the MRI imaging at the doctor was fantastic. Really great idea. My father is claustrophobic and had to be put under general anesthesia."
00:51:00
to have his MRI and so I can really resonate with the positivity there.
00:59:00
"Thinking about that particular, like you mentioning, benefits of using VR, how can children and families use VR in positive or helpful ways?"
01:11:00
I think there's a lot of potential in exploring things that are too expensive to explore otherwise. And so I think that that's probably the biggest benefit.
01:23:00
What kind of problems might VR create for children and families?
01:31:00
"The lack of touch. So touch is an important cessation. When my daughter and I were in the virtual environment together, we touched hands virtually. Now that I think back on that, I think that's interesting that in order to be connected to each other, we actually reached out and touched hands virtually. So I think the sense of touch is what's missing from VR. This is like the VR, we all have to be here."
01:57:00
"It did after I touched her hand, which is interesting because it wasn't her hand, it was her VR hand. Then I was like, oh, yep, you're there. I touched you. Did you get feedback that you touched her? Yeah, she told me. Oh. Yeah, there you are. And then we touched hands, both of us, and we talked about it."
02:15:00
"Oh, you talked. Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah. But no, I never actually touched her. I understood. Yeah. So, but that feedback in the VR was missing for you. Well, that was... Yeah, I needed that, so I created it virtually. Yeah, in order to know it was actually her, because it was just a square box, a gold box for her head. But after I touched her hand, and my hand touched in the virtual environment, that was the connection that I was like, okay, let's go explore."
02:43:00
We should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children.
02:49:00
"probably a combination of parents, children."
03:00:00
Excuse me.
03:05:00
"people that create the experiences. Not individuals, but committees. So I think back to video game design and how you can really create a video game that negatively impacts a person's psyche. And so I think it's important to keep it in mind for the example of"
03:29:00
"In virtual reality you can actually shoot someone, kill someone, and you know, roll the warcraft. I don't think that's healthy, I don't think that's a good idea. And so I think virtual reality, as we get closer and closer to reality that doesn't have implications or impacts, negative impacts or consequences, consequences is what I'm looking for there, that we need to be careful that we still separate reality and virtual reality and maybe bring some more of our..."
03:58:00
"values, laws, ethics into the virtual environment. I don't think that we should be participating in things that we can't participate, that hurt other people, that's what I'm saying. When creators design VR for kids and families, what important things do you keep in mind? I think the stuff I just said is mostly what I think about. The content, yeah."
04:27:00
"hurting other people. Even in a virtual environment, hurting other people becomes normal in your mind. And then you move back into an actual environment. You don't understand the same. You break with reality too much. The consequences aren't there. The fact that this is an actual person with their own reality. And the fact that the way that you impact that reality."
04:57:00
"So you're worried about the psychological and emotional impact? Yes. Any other concerns? No, I mean... Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about the VR for kids and families that you thought of but we didn't talk about? No, I mean I just think it's a really fun thing and it's a fun thing that you can do really great experiences for really low cost. I mean I love being in the space station. That would never have been in it."
05:26:00
"something that I could have done ever. But I guess I do it. It felt like I did anyway. So yeah, I really enjoyed that. And it felt safer than actually being in space, I suppose. Oh, right. Yeah. Because I'm sitting in a chair. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not really zero gravity environment. No, but when I was scared, it was so real that I was scared when I looked down because I was so high."
05:54:00
"Thank you so much, that was really helpful. Yeah, you too. Very, very good."
