"I'm going to start by asking you what did you think about the use of VR in these stories in both the context of health or education? Overall, I think it could be beneficial to relax in children in the doctor's office, getting more details and covering more ground in a quicker fashion. I see. Okay. Are there other parts of other stories that stood out to you? No."
00:28:00
"If you can think about like maybe how can children or families use VR in maybe positive or helpful ways? Turn the game situation into life and educational purposes. Oh, okay. So you like that scenario with the education part? Which of the stories in education? Not necessarily just the story, just in general."
00:58:00
"and making the education piece more fun with interactive games scenario. Okay, so for both Maya and Kobe, as one story. Yes. What maybe some of the issues or problems might be or create for children and families? I just, I don't know the, I'd be concerned of the long term screen time. Screen time is always a concern."
01:27:00
"screen time. Okay, so you see this as a screen time. Yeah, potentially, I mean, yes. Is there any specific situation in which VR should not be used? Not that I can think of currently. Okay, yeah. Who do you think should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children?"
01:51:00
"I think the parent input and research is ultimately going to be the key points. If it's research to be a positive, then I guess it's got to go to further study. Further study? What type of research are you thinking of? Just features, benefits, just like you would with anything before."
02:16:00
it hits market or before we start using it as a training tool and safety and all of those things. Okay. Can you give examples of other people that might be involved in this decision making or just parents and researchers?
02:34:00
"Stop my head, no. So here's a question. When creators design VR for children or for families, what important things should they keep in mind? Contents. Content, OK. Um."
02:55:00
"The ability, the simplification. I mean making sure that it either starts at a very entry level and you can advance. I mean I don't know how all that stuff works but something of that caliber. And then the weight of the headset. I mean I was fine but size and comfort of the headset itself."
03:23:00
"for kids you mean? Yeah. I see, okay. Is there other other examples of conservation besides the size of the VR and the content? Okay. Anything else that you would like to tell us? Nothing I can think of. Okay, thank you so much sir. That was wonderful. Thank you. Absolutely. I appreciate your time."
