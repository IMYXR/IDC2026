"So, to start with, what did you think about the US, the use of VR in these stories and if there's any particular parts that stood out to you? Being a user or being a, having seen it first hand with students using VR on a short term basis, I see it actually as a benefit because they get to see things maybe that they may not be able to ever get to see in real life."
00:28:00
"But using a VR for more than one or two hours at a time, brain developments affected, headaches, it may not come up right away, but it's one of those situations where extended use, overuse, is gonna be the problem."
00:43:00
"And you're talking about both adults and kids? Adults and kids because adults are even as old as they age too. I've noticed since I age is that you even become with motion and everything else, you can have eye problems, you get headaches easier, the bright lights flashing, it all affects you in a way."
01:04:00
"Okay, so that's all like some of the concerns that you have. Those are some of the concerns. I also see the benefits. There's, you have... Let's talk a little bit about that. How can children and families use VR in positive or helpful ways? VR? Positive ways would be definitely distance. Distance being able to see relatives would be a good way. Being able to maybe have a family game night. When we have family game nights, we'll have a tournament. If it'd be..."
01:33:00
"like Beat Saber or having something with any one of the other games or sometimes you want to ride the roller coaster, the virtual roller coaster on there and freak each other out, see who can be, sit there the longest without moving, but yet keep it limited. Keep it limited. Have an hour, maybe two hours at the most and then you have to take a break, set it down. I don't care if you have to charge it, whatever, get outside and go do something."
01:58:00
"So what other problems that you might be able to create for children and families besides the time cap limit? I mean, sometimes you get, I see it happen where it almost, as if the kids become disconnected from what's going on, they become disconnected in their own home. You can call."
02:18:00
"call them two or three times and ask them what's going on. Hey, are you there? And finally you have to go check on them and they become so immersed in that they really lose track of time. They lose track of what's going on around them. And that's when you tell them you have to take a break. You need to take a break from this and know there's something else going on in the house rather than just this. But there's any times that you can, they find a lot of the YouTube shorts actually watching something or doing something on there. It is, it is helpful. I've looked back and looked at the history"
02:48:00
"it and it's actually very cool. What you do see, they're like, oh they're actually using it for something other than just gaming. They're watching, maybe watching movies, maybe they'll watch some YouTube videos that are YouTube shorts. They love watching Mark Rober. I mean, who doesn't like watching that guy build squirrel machines?"
03:10:00
"Yeah, so is there a specific situation which VR should not be used? I would think in a long-term situation, anything long-term that more than, I mean if you're looking more than two hours, it shouldn't be. Because..."
03:30:00
"You have to give your brain time to take a break from that, your eyes take a break. If you're not giving that, you're going to have problems. And overuse time and time and time again of that extended period is going to be causing an issue. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for kids?"
03:51:00
"regulators should really pay attention to what they're doing. Regulators. Yup, the ones that are producing it. I mean, they should know what, yes, they're producing it, but they should have other precautionary ways of putting it all, when they actually, when they're putting these together and then also market it. They need to be careful if you're not marketing it towards young kids. Right. Making it, making it, hey, this looks like it's going to be fun, but yet as soon as an adult looks at it, it's like..."
04:18:00
"What were they thinking? No. As a parent, I would be very concerned sometimes of what some of the stuff is out there. And with the approval process, you still have to... We can't... They can't install anything unless we approve it. So I mean, it has to be something that they..."
04:35:00
"So parents too. Yeah, we have control of what our kids see on their VR headset. Other people, can you think of other examples that might be involved in the making of VR? No, as far as that, I can't think of any other examples of that, but that would help. Okay, so one last question. When creators designed VR for children or for families?"
05:03:00
"What important things they should keep in mind? As the wife says, keep the blood and guts out of it. Keep the really graphic, the graphic nature of it out. So the content? The content. Yes, they're trying to create a content that is extremely, they want to draw in a crowd, but yet they don't have to make it graphic like some of these Warzone games you see. It doesn't need to be that graphic."
05:33:00
"that are challenging, that are more puzzle related. Even like some of them that are out there are like your escape rooms where you actually have to do something in the room to make your way through. Those are the types of games that are fun to see. I see. Okay. Any other examples of specifics or considerations? No. I can't think of anything."
05:59:00
"Anything in general that you thought of during the study about the VR use? I'm just glad. The videos that were selected, it's interesting to see that I've noticed these in real life. You know, having a full classroom, doing that for seven hours would not be anything that I would want my child to go through. Because the brain development at that young age, they shouldn't be having that much..."
06:29:00
"they still need to be able to be a kid, but having that strapped to their head for a full day would not be any way I want to see my kid do it. Besides this time cap, is there other concerns of using this? I don't have any other concerns for it. I mean I see it as a learning tool that I also see as an entertainment but with limited use it you keep control of it."
06:54:00
"something enjoyable. VR is cool. When you say control it, what parts of this experience control? Control? Yeah. Just making sure that they're being cognizant of how much time they're actually spending on it. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you so much."
