"I'm going to start asking you what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? What part of these stories specifically stood out to you in the context of health and at home? Okay, so there was four videos really I watched there. So the ones at the doctor's office, the first one."
00:17:00
"I think it started off on a really positive note where if it helps take the child's mind off of pain, especially if you can take the child's mind off of pain without the use of any kind of medication or products, things like that, that's obviously hugely beneficial. But then it kind of crossed the line where the kid stopped wanting to do PT because all he wanted to do was the VR. So I feel like it could be immensely beneficial. But then..."
00:46:00
"it has to be balanced. And that mirrored the story of the family at home, the first story. There's a lot of positives to it, but it has to be balanced, like any technology. I don't feel like it's any different than anything that kids and families have now, though, because the same thing happens with cell phones and tablets and all of these things. There can be a lot of positive uses, but it can very easily cross into the line of becoming not as positive."
01:15:00
Can you talk more about that? Help me.
01:19:00
"context about what you were talking about, the crossing of the line. Like I said, like in the hospital, I kind of cross that line to where, you know, it started as a positive thing, but then I cross that line into he doesn't want to do PT. Right. And so the family, you know, they were doing good things. That was the way the kid connects with family, and we live in a little bit more of a rural area, and my kid's a little bit unique, you know, and so it can be hard for him to find friends. And so if it's a way for kids, just thinking from our mind, living in a rural area where he doesn't find a lot of kids like him."
01:49:00
"a lot of times he connects with kids online. You know, through out-school classes or things like that. So it's really beneficial."
01:57:00
"But then the line, you know, where do you draw that line between like, okay, they're not responding, they're not coming to dinner. You get so engrossed in your technology that you're disconnecting from the real world. And so, but I think that's like any technology. I don't think that that is VR specific or that it's any worse with VR because you think of kids now with Tik Tok, just watching Tik Tok endlessly and making Tik Toks and texting and sitting at a dinner table and not paying attention or things like that. I don't think."
02:27:00
"gets any different. You know, it's just another tool, it's another piece of technology that there's benefits but there also needs to be limitations to encourage healthy use. So let's just talk a little bit about that, the problems that you foresee that these are problems. How, you know, what problems... I want to focus on VR. This behavior."
02:53:00
"cause problems for your child or children in general? What type of problems? Like, if they spend too much time in this. Um, and I guess it really depends on what exactly they would be doing within VR. Because if they're, you know, like in the videos."
03:12:00
"if the one boy is coming home from school and he's playing with his friends. So he's communicating with his friends, he's still talking, he's making connections. But where's the boy in the hospital? It sounded like he was just playing video games. So it was kind of isolating him further in a way. I see. So isolation is an issue, okay? It could be, but again that's like any technology. I don't think I saw anything in the videos that was..."
03:42:00
unique problem to VR. Everything that I saw seemed to be just the downfalls are the same as that of other technology that kids and families have access to. Which is the balance or time. Is there other problems that you might foresee that VR specifically? The only thing and I mean I didn't see it specifically in the videos but I've kind of...
04:05:00
"I just wonder, because I don't know enough about it, does any type of extended use of VR, I'm thinking of it like after you get off a ship for a while, you kind of have your sea legs, you know? Is there anything with the visual, if kids are using, if they're on the VR for two, three hours and then they take it off, how do the eyes respond? How do they adjust then? Is there any?"
04:33:00
"any other kind of anything that impacts them in that way. And I don't know. I don't know, but that would be my question. That would be something I would want to know, especially if we're talking younger children who aren't as developed. That's just kind of my wondering. Kind of like after you've been on a cruise ship or something, like you get off and you feel like the ground is moving, you know? Yeah, yeah. Who should decide which of our experiences are suitable for children?"
05:03:00
Um...
05:08:00
"parents, ultimately parents, but I think there should be some, what's the word I want to use here, some caveats on that."
05:23:00
"You know, video games have rating systems, movies have rating systems. Obviously that doesn't necessarily stop a child from playing those, but there should be things such as warnings and ratings so that parents are aware so that they can make an informed decision. Because there's certainly some VR experiences that would not be appropriate for young children. So..."
05:49:00
"Ultimately parents with information. With information, yeah. So other people. When creators design VR for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind?"
06:02:00
Um...
06:08:00
"I think, well, and this would be the creators of systems or just the games, the content? Both. Both, okay. As far as the systems, I think ensuring that something is built into the system that parents can have control, kind of like timers, so they can set limitations on how much time a child is allowed to use it. Kind of like on tablets or devices or on Wi-Fi systems where parents can set it to cut off at a certain time. I think that's really important."
06:38:00
"I think the educational aspect, you know, nothing that I really saw talks about any kind of educational aspect. And I think my brain just goes there, we homeschool. And so my first thought is, like, we're on the International Space Station, like, what a phenomenal educational application this has, that you can actually go. And I was, honestly, I was expecting when I saw it, like, at the doctor's office, using that to kind of show kids what's going to happen during a procedure."
07:06:00
"to minimize that anxiety. Because I know there's things like some facilities, they have facility dogs. And they'll actually do procedures on dogs in front of the children to show them. And the kids see it happen on the dog, and they're like, oh, OK, the dog, that's how they would put an IV in. And I see that. So now I don't feel so scared because I know what's going to happen."
07:29:00
"So using that to kind of show kids what's going to happen during a procedure or maybe even more cool, like if a kid's gonna have to be quick to sleep to have like a scope or something like that, like actually do a VR of what it would be like to be in that scoping, going through a body, you know, get kids excited and interested and engaged with it. So they're like, that's so cool, you know, and they make me like, can I see the video of mine now?"
07:55:00
"and really get the buy-in for these things. So it's not just a distraction, but it's also helping lessen their anxiety. It's not just covering it. It's actually helping them work through it. And I didn't see that in these videos. I saw masking. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yep. But what I saw was masking, but I think what would be nice is more helping the child work through it."
08:24:00
"That's a great idea. Anything else around that point before I move on? I think the last question I have for you is is there anything else that you wanted to, that you thought of, that you want to tell us about the VR for kids and family but we didn't really get to talk about? I think it could also have phenomenal applications for things like pediatric therapies."
08:50:00
"especially things like maybe occupational therapies or stuff like that because it can make it a little bit more fun because a kid might not Want to take tweezers and pick up little pebbles, you know But if they're in VR if they can have some kind of a tool That that goes with it for the hands where they might in reality be using tweezers to pick up pebbles But what they're seeing is they're using these giant monster claws to pick up aliens You know, it makes it so much more fun"
09:20:00
So I think it could have phenomenal applications for pediatric therapies and just making them more fun. Like I was expecting like in the one doctor video maybe like he's having trouble doing PT. Well he can put on the VR and he can actually walk up the Alps or something you know or like walk on this cool other planet or walk under the ocean. So that it kind of takes the mind off of I'm having to walk. It's like I want to walk because this is so cool.
09:50:00
"And that's, I think that would be incredible. That's awesome. Yeah. Anything else? Sorry, I know I could probably talk for a long time. No, it's fine. We're here for it. That's probably good."
