R: Thank you so much. So what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? And if you can speak to the parts that stood out to you.
"P1:  Yeah, so I'll talk about school first. I think the idea of VR replacing the whole in-person experience at school is really scary. And part of it is because after living in the pandemic for two years, when we did have virtual learning, I did see negative effects with my child and like social development has been something on my radar because of that. But the use of it in terms of like a replacement of sometimes like a field trip makes sense because then learning experiences I think could be enriched and enhanced. But I don't think it replaces the total in-person experience that children should have."
"R: Can you speak a little bit more about that experience, your child social development part you mentioned?"
01:12:00
"P1: Yeah, yeah. So I have found, I mean even specifically with my son right sitting next to me, that there are certain behavior in how to act in a crowd together and what is socially acceptable right now. The rules have not changed since pre-COVID, but I think the interaction amongst the kids and how they talk to each other and interact and like, what's appropriate energy level? What's not appropriate energy level? What's an appropriate use of our body and what's not?"
"Those things that you learn in kindergarten but because he did experience kindergarten virtually. And then I had a second son, my younger son, who was in kindergarten last year and had the full in-person experience and even the experience of sitting on a rug and listening to your teacher. It's like understanding what to do with your body while you're in the learning environment and he didn't get it as much. So to me that has really been detrimental. So it's like one example."
"I even think like making friends. and being in person with friends. And it's these unsaid social things that you don't get in a virtual environment, right? And maybe they would, but that's just like my observation in having two children who kind of experience that."
"And so I kind of equated a lot to like that moment when we were all trying to learn over Zoom that it's been very similar. I also think Technology in schools can be scary and concerning because I don't think that we teach children how to use it properly and I have like a child who gets distracted easily. And the line between tech time for learning and tech time for pleasure or fun is very blurred. And so we've had issues where we get off task in what we're doing. So I would imagine in the virtual reality world, the same can happen and be true. Yeah."
03:14:00
R: Can think of how can children and families use VR in positive or helpful ways.
"P1: Yeah, um...So you know right now I see it as like a way to spend time. I don't know, like families. I don't know. To me it's like a replacement for like video games, which I'm not opposed to video games. They're fun. You can have connection with them too. It's a certain kind of connection. And I don't think there's anything wrong with getting wrapped up in a story and an experience."
"But it's not understanding human connection in a nuanced way. You know? So you're still talking about the problems and issues around. Yeah. And I know I guess, yeah, I don't think it's a bad thing, but it's all about moderation, right? But it's just another thing that parents now have to really focus on and kind of like be responsible for the teaching of which is just one more you know they're just I don't know."
04:19:00
R: I know that you kind of mentioned some pieces of problems that you foresee using VR but is there other kinds of problems that might VR create for children and family that you haven't mentioned or spoken about?
04:43:00
"P1: The nuanced human connection, I kind of said. I think the distractability and transitions. Like I think with young kids, transitions are really hard and like the start and stop is always tricky. Like I think something that could help would be, and VR probably has this, Oculus probably has this, but like timers."
"We find that extremely helpful where it's like, okay, the experience just shuts off and it's time for it to be done, right? And so it's like those transitions can be tricky and I would imagine in VR, that's also the case, right? Because you're completely immersed. Even as an adult, you're like, okay, it's time to stop. You're like, okay, we gotta stop now, right? Yeah, who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for kids? Yeah, oh."
"That's really tricky and I don't even think it's a black and white answer because I have a lot of trust in our education system, but I also know that like, I also question, it's a spectrum right? And I don't know, I feel like there needs to be more data behind the research to inform a little more and not just as strict as like the American pediatric because I….I have a lot of trust in that body, but sometimes I don't feel like it's aligned with reality and what parents actually experience. So it's kind of like both. It's like we need to find information from all sources, whether it be education, kind of science-backed information, and then parents at the end of the day have to kind of make that choice on their own, but have some data to back up their choices."
06:27:00
"And then within schools, I mean, I don't know. I don't even know if I have the answer. I don't even know, right? But I know if I saw something and I'd be like, this feels concerning, I'd maybe say something, but at the end of the day it's not a perfect system. Right, right. You know?"
"R: Yeah, yeah. It's a hard question to answer. No, I appreciate the nuance that you shed light on. Yeah, yeah. And you kind of gave some examples of, yeah, who could be involved, right? Yeah. One last question, when creators design these VR experiences for kids and children, even contacts for families, what important things they should keep in mind?"
07:10:00
"P1: Well, I would hope some of them would be parents themselves and understand the complexity of that, of trying to give your child as much enriching experiences as possible, but also kind of vet those potential dangerous…  I mean, like cyberbullying of course, the disconnection of reality and like social nuance, those are things I would want them to know. And then the other thing, which this is not, this is so idealistic, but like let's not have it be about a stock price and always about making money, right? And like the greater good rather than…..But that's not really America, but you know what I mean? Right?"
"Well, I'll just say I'm gonna speak a little bit more personally, but I do work for a big company, a big corporation, and big corporations need to take responsibility, and sometimes we're just so beholden to stock price that it's not always like, it's not always the right choice because the thing that makes more money is not the thing that's the right socially or like betterment. You know?"
"R: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I totally understand. You're talking about the context of the family and also the context of society."
"P1: The context of the family and society. Well, because really, society to me is like the family, right? Like it's about... I don't know.."
R: No no I appreciate that perspective.
08:56:00
"P1: Society is the family, I don't know, right? not if you're not part of a traditional family unit but it's just there's generational within the one little like unit right and like I don't know."
"R: So thinking from that lens and like kind of going back to the other question, do you think there's you know other people need to be involved in the decision-making?"
09:25:00
"P1:  Well, I think inherently there will be just because like those not everybody within those like buckets of even education and science and like government to some degree, right, are all of them are going to have their own like personal experiences and whether they're part of like family units or not. I don't know is that what you meant? I don't know."
09:35:00
R: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
"P1: Like everybody brings their personal self into like then making that like decision, the greater decision."
R: Right. We were talking about implicit bias and fast experiences. Yes. Yes. Right. Which is important to represent parents and families in some of these decisions we make.
P1:Totally.
R: Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about the VR for kids or family that you didn't get the chance to speak to?
10:00:00
"P1: I appreciated the medical uses because it actually spun it in a different direction than I expected. I expected it to be more about, I don't know, like not actually interacting with the medical field or the doctor. And so I know that's like something I really value is the personal human connection with like the doctor or caretaker, but then using it as a way to distract from the potential procedure or scary moments because going to the doctor or having those procedures is really scary for everybody involved. So yeah, yeah. So I thought it was like really positive in that way. Those were positive examples I thought."
"R: Yeah, so it's basically the context and it's similar, it's like supplementing."
"P1: Yeah, yeah, rather than it just being about, you know, like the smaller interactions. Yeah."
"R: If you don't have anything else, we are thankful. Thank you so much for being part of this Study."
"P1: Oh, this is fun!"
