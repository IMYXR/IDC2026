So what did you think about the use of VR and the stories? And how did you? Like when you were using the VR yourself? How was that experience? What stood out?
Child  5:16
It was confusing.
Speaker 1  5:17
Yeah. How was it on the stories when they use VR? What did you think about?
Speaker 2  5:27
"I think that like, it's good to, like, see casting, if you can just like when you're across like, the world from someone or like, you can't like travel to them. But I think it's also that you shouldn't do it too much."
Speaker 1  5:53
"Yeah, for sure. Do you think there's any like foreigners to using VR?"
Speaker 2  6:07
"You can get dizzy. Like you might get, you might be doing too much. Or"
Researcher  6:26
"who you think should decide about different VR? Rituals? Like, should it be adults, parents, teachers shouldn't be the kids,"
Speaker 2  6:55
I think it depends on what you want.
Researcher  7:01
Can you give examples?
Speaker 2  7:07
"if it's for, like a teacher, then I'd say, I do like in a cat in education. But then, like, if it's just like parents, then like, they might say, like, you want. Like, the parent might say.....you have to like, tell me what you're doing. Before you do, then we'll decide what? Well, like, I don't know how the VR headset works. But like, do you play on a TV? Or play on a TV and then you just put your headset on?"
Speaker 1  7:58
"Yeah, so there's like a phone in there. So whatever you can watch on a phone you should be able to use in VR."
Speaker 2  8:03
"So like, maybe just do it on a TV and then like, just have a parent watch what you're doing. Yeah, casting."
Speaker 1  8:12
"When people are creating different VR experiences for children, what do you what should they keep in mind?"
Speaker 2  8:20
"Keep in mind, like what was parents? Yeah, for sure."
Speaker 1  8:25
"And then finally, is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for children for families or anything related to your own experience?"
Child  8:36
"Make some lighter, lighter."
Researcher  8:38
"Yeah. Was it a little bit too heavy? Yeah, did it hurt your head?"
Speaker 2  8:42
"Not too much. Just felt heavy. So total for me to like, remember to like, and maybe like, like in the game, maybe like you should see like, it's your stuff on your head, like a helmet or something? Because it does like a helmet on they'll don't just like make it heavier than like, if you're just making peel really like, Oh,"
Speaker 1  9:06
"that's really smart. Yeah, that's really good. I do that. Is there anything else you want to tell me? No, no."
