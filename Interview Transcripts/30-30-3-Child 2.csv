So what did you think about the use of VR in stories?
Child  0:28
"At the doctor when the boy, he got the VR headset, and then he was told to get the exercises, and instead of doing exercises, he did the VR headset, he probably wasn't getting better, and he probably got worse. So I don't think the VR helped in that way. But when the girl went to the doctor, I think that helped her because it took her mind off of what was happening, and she wasn't so worried. And then at home, I think it was a little dangerous for the mom to be cooking and using the VR headset. But the hockey game, and Minecraft was a good idea just past time. And then the second one at home was...."

Meeting with their grandparents and what?
Child  1:20
I forgot.
Researcher  1:21
They can come up with remotes communicate with their family.
Child2  1:24
"Oh, yeah, that was a very good idea."
Researcher  1:26
"Yeah, the How about your feelings"
Child2  1:29
"Emm, for the at home one where Kobe, where he plays Minecraft, I think that would be fine. And it would just be like fun, it wouldn't really be educational or anything. But for the mom to be cooking I have that was dangerous, especially if she has to use knives. Yeah. So far in the hockey game, I thought that was a good idea. Because then like everyone can watch whatever they want, and they don't have to fight about it. And then for the one with the grandparents, I thought that was a good idea for the people that they're like sad or something because I can't see their family that year. And then that makes them happy that they could like play games with them. And I thought that one would be a good one. For the one at school, I thought the one for the history class, I thought that'd be a good idea. Because then it'll keep kids paying attention and wanting to like look around, unlike in a book where they just look in the book and then kind of get bored. And for the dinosaurs, I thought that was a good idea. Because then they can like see them and see their size and everything. And then like actually see what they look like not just the skeletons."

"Yeah, just so you are actually you're all noting the benefits and issues of using VR. So do you want to add any other advantage pros and cons options in VR? (both said no)"
So the next question would be a really big one. So who should decide which we are experienced? choice for kids?
Child  3:18
"Parents. If you don't want your kid like doing something, like kind of like screentime yeah, there's so just so that they're not like out of hand."
Child2  3:35
"Oh wait, what was the question?"
Researcher  3:37
So who should decide which we are experienced as suitable? Okay.
Child2  3:42
Probably the parents
Researcher  3:45
"Yeah, you agree with the officer like parents? Okay, that's a good point. So when we are makers create VR experience for children is there something you think is very important for them to keep in mind?"
Child  3:59
"I'm probably not making it like too tricky, making it like easy to use relate to child. And having a variety of things to do."
Child2  4:18
Probably make it like buttons easy to use on the controllers.
Researcher  4:22
It's hard to remember which function related to each button?
Child2  4:27
"No, they were easy just like I've tried like one before where it's kind of hard to use. Yeah, and then also to like make sure that the screen to like the where you put it on your head that it's comfortable. Otherwise you'll want to like take it off right away."
Researcher  4:47
"Oh, do want to add something? So the last one, is there anything else you want to tell me about how kids use VR?"
Child  5:00
"I think if we got VR at school, kids would have a better time learning things."
Researcher  5:08
"Yeah. So like all kids use VR in school or like in their home, but going to the remote school. I don't know what I mean, like, how do you mean about like using VR in school, in virtural school or real school?"
Child  5:22
"Like, you go to school and like, for sure in classes that they don't have like in the school, you could do it virtually, instead of having to like, not take that class at all since they don't offer that class."
Researcher  5:33
"Oh, okay, cool. That's a good idea. So is there anything else you want to tell me about how kids use VR? Okay, great."
