"I have a few questions for you, I will record the answers so that we don't miss kind of things that. So what did you think about the use of AI in these stories?"
Speaker 1  0:08
"I think that VR is good in some areas. But some of the experiences like the smelling, tasting, the feeling of touching is lost in these VR. Yeah. So there's some really awesome benefits to it. Like, you know, space station was really good. We'll never get to go to space. But then like, seeing, like field trips and museums, you learn how to stand in line, you learn how to wait your turn, you learn how to listen, and not be distracted. It's a kind of like those people skills you learn. Yeah, there's benefits. And there's like, not benefits, kind of like it's overused in that."
Qiao Jin  0:45
That's one disadvantages for you. Yeah.
Speaker 1  0:49
"Yeah, it gets overused sometimes in some of those skills that kids have it, they get lost in the gaming. So like, if they want to do VR, physical therapy with me, he's quitting his physical therapy to do VR and Minecraft would say, well, he's losing that motivation to get up and go where the body can do amazing things. And he gives up. I mean, there's really great things about it. And then there's like, not great things about it. So it's kind of like finding that happy medium."
Qiao Jin  1:19
"So to say any other issues or problems that we might create for the duo. Is there any other issues or problems that we are nice? Okay, I know like you already mentioned somebody will say, like others do. Yeah,"
Speaker 1  1:32
"like, so like, the students like we go to a museum, they can they smell and they see and you feel"
Qiao Jin  1:41
"like you have some like physical feedback. Yeah. Yeah. So and then like,"
Speaker 1  1:45
"can you do chemistry? You can smell the like,"
Qiao Jin  1:48
you know what I mean? Yeah. The multi sensory?
Speaker 1  1:52
"Yeah. And then you can like, you'll know that taste in your mouth. And you just, you just know. And like the or I don't know, I'm not very experienced with it. It just seems it takes that element of gut instinct away."
Qiao Jin  2:02
That's a good point. So let's start with the big question. Who should decide which way I experienced as Sue for 14?
Speaker 1  2:12
"Oh, that's really hard. Yeah, I guess, parents parents should have an input. And I think educators should have an input because the school like, like the service system should watch because they'll see they should watch the growth of children, children that do VR in one school, and then children don't do VR in one school and see the effect as it goes on."
Qiao Jin  2:31
So there needs to have some like highlighting stay. Yeah.
Speaker 1  2:35
"So do it. Like as one school does all VR, and then the other school does it you don't like? Do it compares"
Qiao Jin  2:41
the comparison. Yeah. So when creator design we are for kids and families. What important thing to say keep in mind
Speaker 1  2:54
"that people get people are losing the ability to just communicate without tech. What do you mean, what's the impact of the air?"
Qiao Jin  3:01
"I mean, I when we are makers to use some new applications for case, do you have some suggestions for them all? Like, are there something important they should keep in mind?"
Speaker 1  3:12
"Sometimes we're not kids using like one of the older boys has new so they get disorientated with it and they forget, like they get like, we'll use it and then they take it off. And they said sometimes you feel like you're still in that game and seeing the pixels. And I was like, oh, yeah, and"
Qiao Jin  3:28
"I was like, isolated."
Speaker 1  3:31
"Yeah, and then they forget what's real with speak and then it's like, sometimes smell."
Qiao Jin  3:36
"Yeah. Do you have any suggestions for like to sway or makers? Oh,"
Speaker 1  3:41
"no, I think it's just gonna take time trial and error. Okay,"
Qiao Jin  3:45
"great. So is there anything else you want to talk about about Casio the VR? Okay, thank you so much."
