"So we would like to know what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of these stories stood out to you? You watched at home, sorry at school? I watched the school and the doctor. So I liked the school that was like after school just as like a learning, extra learning opportunity. Like in supplementing real school, I thought that could be a really cool thing."
00:27:00
"But I didn't like the thought of like that being the entire school experience I thought that would be a long time to be in a VR set for the whole day And I feel like the kid would miss out on like real experiences of being in a classroom with a bunch of other kids. Expression, eye contact, sidetalk…"
00:46:00
"So, kind of explicitly thinking about how could VR benefit children? How can children use, or families, use VR in benefit or positive ways? I think it's super engaging, so being able to actually go to the museum, see the museum like that, would be really more engaging than clicking through it on a website or something like that. It makes it a lot more real. So, I think that is..."

to actually learn stuff while they're doing something kind of novel and really interesting.
01:27:00
problems my VR create for children and families.
01:32:00
"things to do to their brain, like just having that headset on so much. It's like, I know when I put it on I felt a little bit dizzy right away, and so I wonder if it would cause headaches or what kind of physical issues it might create for kids. But I think, like occasionally, it probably would be fine. I just would worry about doing it a prolonged period of the day,"
02:04:00
else? Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? I mean ultimately I think their parents should have the final say but I think people who know most about it and who've done the research on it should have a bigger say in it than just people who create it or whatever like people who've actually spent the time doing doing the research and
02:33:00
"are familiar with it. So not like legislators, I don't think they would, they're not as familiar with it as a teacher, the creator of it or something. So I would think that people, ultimately the people who are most familiar with it should be able to drop the guidelines better, but ultimately the parents should have a final say. If they don't want their kid to do it, then they shouldn't have to."
02:57:00
"When creators design VR for kids and families, what important things they should keep in mind? I think that it should be educational more than fun, just so that it doesn't just develop another addiction for kids to technology. So if it's educational and it's going to enhance their learning more than anything we already currently have, then I think it would be a lot more fun."
03:23:00
"useful than if it's like, well you could do this learning this way or this way or through VR That's not as cool as like if it's something totally new and different that you couldn't do You know without the VR. Can you tell me, maybe give me an example? Well like the example we saw like going to the actual museum and like seeing that or like, you know like you can watch an episode of"
03:45:00
magic school bus where they're like we're driving into the digestive system but like to actually have a VR headset and experience that would be way more intense and great more learning than just watching it on TV or like reading it out of a book so whenever it could like really enhance what they learn because of the experience that they would see it in then I think VR would be better. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about VR that you thought of but didn't get the best?
04:14:00
to talk about? I think I would just say it would be the most important to like make sure that there have been studies on like how it affects kids brains and like how it affects their like their physical well-being like is it hurting their eyes is it hurting like you know like how much is too much how much is a limit like just to make sure that it's not just something that we think oh this is cool and then years later we find out oh we really damaged their brains with this or we really
04:43:00
"developed an addiction to it or something like that. So just that we're making sure that kids' safety is first, I guess. Great, thank you. Yeah, thank you. No, that's good. This is wonderful."
