"Awesome. So could you please tell us what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of these stories stood out to you in the two contexts, in the areas that you've seen? The one at home stood out because it essentially alienated the families. They're all doing their own thing instead of being a family. They're all in their own little world, virtual world, instead of being together."

"As for the doctor, the one with the MRI machine, where they put it on the girl so they could ease her. That worked much better than the other guy not doing his exercises. So for a side track, or a diversion I guess, for the MRI that would be good, but the other stuff I don't see as good. I see."
00:55:00
"Kind of thinking about the possible ways, how can children and families use VR in positive, helpful ways? Or how can it be beneficial to children and families? Children and families, I think the only one I can think of is the doctor one. Actually showing the virtual reality of what's going to happen at the doctor's office."
01:20:00
"That's about, that's the only one I can think of. That's the only one? Okay. So what maybe kinds of problems might they create for children? That they're gonna be in their own little world and not experience anything real life. They're not gonna get out and get dirty. They're not gonna go out and play sports. They're gonna do everything on a computer. Can you tell us a little bit more? Why do you think these could be problematic? Because they'll sit at home and do all this stuff instead of making friends, instead of making connections."
01:48:00
"exercising, anything like that. It's all going to be computer based. And you see that as an issue? I see that as a problem, that's an issue, yes. What could, you know, if you can tell us a little bit of examples of what could that create? Like the one where he just sat in his house playing Minecraft instead of going outside and playing hockey, baseball, whatever, stuff like that. Yeah, they're making friends but..."
02:12:00
"They're not real friends, they're not actual human connections, they're virtual connections. You need that in the real world, like you and I talking. Somebody that just does virtual, they're going to be shy in talking to a real human. Okay? That's what I see. I see. Who do you think should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Parents. Parents? Both parents. Both parents, okay."
02:38:00
"Is there any other entity that should be involved in this decision making? No, not for children. I think just the parents. Parents? Whether school wants to bring it in or a doctor's office wants to bring it in, parents have final say. I see. When creators design VR for kids and family, what important things they should keep in mind? The important thing is age relevance, if that makes sense, where don't get too complicated for a younger kid."
03:08:00
"Um, stuff like that. You know, I, I guess I don't know the right words. Like this one was perfect for the younger ages. Whereas something more complex isn't going to keep a younger age. Um, in tune, I guess they're not going to, they're not going to follow along and get bored with it. That's what I see."
03:28:00
"Just the age part? Is there anything? Just the age part, I guess. It's kind of relevant, I guess. The content, you mean? The content of the VR? Yes. And what age are you thinking of that should be used VR? Or shouldn't be using VR? Well, I guess it all depends. I'd say the age group here is probably 7 to 10. 7 to 10? Yeah, I think so. Awesome. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about VR?"
03:57:00
"you get a chance to? I don't think so. Awesome. Wait, thank you so much!"
