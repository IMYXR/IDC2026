"What do you think about the use of VR in these stories and what part of these stories stood out to you in the context of both health and home? So the health one is kind of nice because a lot of kids are scared of medical stuff so if you can divert them for doing something else while the medical is taking care of them, then they're not so scared because they have to VR and they can look around. You're in a different world. And then for home,"
00:29:00
"I think it helps too because of what happened with coronavirus and stuff. They were isolated but they could still go out and have fun and play. And they're still interacting with people but in a different way. And I'm more of like a tech guy. I want that new Apple headset that they have coming out. But that's way too much for me. Yeah, okay, awesome. So, can you speak to how can children and families benefit or use VR in positive ways?"
01:00:00
"Benefit in a positive way? Yeah, like they can use it in that."
01:08:00
"Well I know that they have like different environments and like games that I think can help with your eye coordination. And then, it's like interacting in real life but it's virtual. Do you have a headset at home? No, but I do want one. You want one, okay. Girlfriend won't let me live."
01:32:00
"often says it's evil. That's why I wanted to try it. I've never tried one before. So what kind of problems might VR create for families and kids? The only problem that I could see is the isolation that they were saying in the video, or the questionnaires where the kid comes home and doesn't even say hi and goes and plays on their VR all day."
01:59:00
"and then they go and eat and go to bed and then go to school, maybe do VR at school because they'd be teaching that in school. It's like a virtual area, it's not real life, so it's probably less communication skills from person to person. That's probably one of the biggest problems. Because I'm kind of like an introvert too, not an extrovert, so I don't have..."
02:29:00
"the pressure or the knowledge or whatever to talk to Raymond people. I don't know how to explain it. No, no, yeah, social skills basically. Yeah, social skills. Social skills is what I can see causing the problem. Causing the problem, okay. Who should decide which VR experiences should be used by kids? Suitable for kids. Who should decide? The parents. Parents, okay. The parents should... The teachers..."
02:57:00
"should ask if it's okay if your kid can experience VR in school. So ultimately basically parents decisions. Yeah, parents decisions. And if we did go back into quarantine with like a virus outbreak, I could see VR working though for in class feel, but you're at home. So I'm kind of like awash, that's why I did. I am neutral or I'm positive for VR."
03:26:00
"Because it's better than sitting on your computer and watching the zoom of your teacher where you can have VR, you can be like in the classroom virtually. Oh, I see. So yeah, that to me is better because it's more feels of you're actually in class. I see. Yeah. So when creators and designers of VR for kids and families, what important things they should keep in mind?"
03:54:00
"Child safety. Safety. Safety, yep. You don't want like these hackers create stuff to get into there and mess with the VR or..."
04:09:00
"You know, like language, you don't want swear words, you don't want like bad images, you need like certain kind of blockers or filters to prevent kids from seeing things that they shouldn't be seeing on VR Oh, content Because you can't see what they're doing, but they can see what they're doing That's true So I think it's more of a content filter, yeah Content, yeah, so the content Or like a way if you can see what your kid's seeing, you can like control what they're doing on the VR You can like..."
04:38:00
"stop it or block it. That's a great idea. Because you don't know what your kid's doing on the VR. It's kind of like on their phones. You don't know what they're doing on their phone. Like our daughter has a phone, but we monitor her and we have an iPhone. So we have that family child control on it. Is there anything else that you want to tell us about the VR for kids and families that you didn't get the chance to talk about or we didn't ask about?"
05:07:00
"pretty much cycle through the whole thing. I think I said more than for certain questions, I guess. I think I'm good. Don't worry about it. No, I don't. I just think we care about what you think. You know, I think I covered everything. That you can think of? Yeah, that I can think of about VR. Okay, awesome, great. I like VR, she doesn't. Thank you. I'm sorry. She doesn't? No. But how come?"
05:34:00
There are so many things that you don't.
05:44:00
"Oh my god, it's a controller!"
05:52:00
I'm coming.
