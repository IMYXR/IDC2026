He's on anything for you. So what did you think about use of we are in this stories.
Speaker 1  0:06
"So the first set of stories, I thought it would be great, especially a kid who just moved into a new place to be able to join in classroom and see other students in their classroom. For the second scenario, I maybe disagreed a little bit more, because everybody in the family was in different parts of the house not interacting with each other. And so I think it's good for a family to interact more"

"physically, together within VR."
So do you see any benefits of using VR for case? Yeah.
Speaker 1  0:47
"Especially when remotes especially from mobile, cool, I think that it's very good. And I think it's good to, for them to meet their friends in Minecraft. I think that opportunity. Yep."
Qiao Jin  0:59
"So I mean, as our usual problem, you'll see like,"
Speaker 1  1:03
"especially, for example, my kids are in a math class outside of their school. So I think it would be a good opportunity for them to see who's in their class, since its people they've never met before."
Qiao Jin  1:15
"And even they are, but if What if they're all in the Avoca? Oh,"
Speaker 1  1:19
"no, it would be good if they could see like each other."
Qiao Jin  1:24
"So when you have bad hair, like tracking? So how should you decide which we are experienced is suitable for kids?"
Speaker 1  1:31
"I think for parents, it would be good for parents to decide for their own children. And then at school, they should get parent feedback about what opportunities kids can use VR for for the classroom."
Qiao Jin  1:44
"Yes, yeah, that makes sense. So when create or design VR applications for case, do you think there are some important things you should keep in mind? Yeah,"
Unknown Speaker  1:54
"I mean, I think we should keep in mind that. Oh, he's trying to make them levels go up and down."
Qiao Jin  2:03
And it's okay.
Speaker 1  2:07
"Um, other important things for them to keep in mind? Yeah, I think we never want kids to spend all their time on technology. So maybe encouraging kids to also take it off and go outside I think would be good to try to strike"
Qiao Jin  2:22
"a balance to save the screen time would be a cool solution,"
Unknown Speaker  2:25
I think. Yeah.
Qiao Jin  2:27
"So how to set up the screen time. I mean, I think, as the developer or the parents, I think"
Unknown Speaker  2:34
"the parents probably Yeah, okay,"
Qiao Jin  2:36
that makes sense. So is there anything else you want to tell me about how kids use VR? Thank you so much. Thank you.
