prep. So what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? I didn't have any major issues with it. A lot of them seemed positive. Only one for me like the when you come home and I see the family's using it that's where it's like yeah I could see that with what cell phones have done in houses I could see that becoming an issue and being a distraction from interacting with real people.
00:24:00
"That being said, the stories where it's like, yeah, your kid's got to sit in a tube and get imaging done, and it's something that can get them through that easier, yeah, that makes sense. Is there other parts of these stories that stood out to you?"
00:41:00
"I'd say those are my main takeaways. So how can children and families use VR in a beneficial way or a positive or helpful way? So, well, I guess the story where they get to interact with their grandparents from a long ways away and couldn't see them in person, yeah, that could be a good use of it, a beneficial use. So what kind of problems might VR create for your kids or just kids in general?"
01:09:00
"I, to me the issues I thought about when I was watching the videos and just in general would be the idea of not connecting with people outside of virtual reality and getting stuck in the virtual reality world. See the funny videos of people going out into the forest with virtual headsets on and trying to interact with nature while they're out in the forest. It's like, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,"
01:40:00
What are some of the situations in which VR should not be used?
01:48:00
"I can't think of any specific situations. I think technology has a lot of potential uses in application and I guess right out of the gates I can't say, oh this just wouldn't work."
02:02:00
Who do you think should decide which of your experiences are suitable for children? Their parents Do you think other entities might be involved or should be involved in making this decision?
02:20:00
I could see guidelines from like federal review entities or groups that have a quantum way in and promote different things just like ratings on movies but I would presume that parents would probably be the best decision makers for the actual use. Can you tell me a little bit more about the guidelines? Who would provide these guidelines and what would these guidelines include? I have no idea.
02:49:00
"Is that something that you rely on in other contexts of talk use for your kids? Yeah, like for us as a family even like movies We look at the motion picture Association ratings on movies for deciding to what our kids watch So, you know something akin to that would make sense to me, but I'll be honest I have no idea what the motion picture Association is. I just know they put the ratings on the movies"
03:17:00
"Trust worthy entities. Yeah. So when creators design VR for kids and maybe for families, what important things should they keep in mind?"
03:31:00
"I don't use VR so I don't really know. Wait, you just use it right now? Yeah, but this is the first time I've ever been on it so... I don't have a lot to offer on it. You said something during the spaceship. The end. Oh, yeah. When you were trying to interact with your sense. It should work. What do you mean by that? Well, I was clicking a button and I didn't go through the door."
04:01:00
"If it is being used, I'd hope it would function efficiently. Oh, okay. Yeah, but the point that when you were trying to interact with your son, being in a spaceship, that you didn't feel that you were in a spaceship. Oh, yeah, yeah. I didn't feel weightless. So, to me, there is some limitations in that it's still just a video. It's not a real experience."
04:22:00
"And then when you tried to interact with your son? Oh yeah, we were sitting next to each other, I tried to touch my son's hand and in the video they touched but we were not touching. Oh you didn't get the feedback? Yeah correct. That's something that you think people should consider when creating a video? Real feedback and interaction, yeah. Is there anything else that you want to tell us about the VR for children and their families that you thought of?"
04:51:00
"I don't think so. Great, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Yeah, thanks. Is this your research project?"
