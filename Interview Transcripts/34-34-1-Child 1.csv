"So, what did you think about use of VR in the store?"
Unknown Speaker  0:12
I would say I will do the once like the....
Researcher  0:23
At school or at home?
Unknown Speaker  0:30
Try it once and see when I actually like act. Make it like a game. So... I would say... I would try it.
Researcher  0:53
"So how about using at school? Like you have some classes us VR, so how do you feel about that?"
Child  1:16
I would feel good.
Researcher  1:22
Why could you tell me to reason?
Child  1:26
About some history?
Researcher  1:28
"Yeah, because like some locations, you can now see there is like some dinosaurs. Yeah, that makes sense. So what kinds of problems might we create for you as kids?"
Child  1:48
After the teachers should get off and studying more?
Researcher  2:00
Could you explain?
Child  2:03
"Like learning about more was much of whatever, whatever the history is."
Researcher  2:12
So do you think like starting from where I cannot get enough information for you to how to learn from other materials. So are there any other problems you see from VR? No. Okay. So next one would be hard to decide which VR experience a good choice for children.
Child  2:37
I would do the monopoly one.
Researcher  2:40
monogamy. Okay. So why? Why is that a good choice? Or like a bad choice?
Unknown Speaker  2:46
"Oh,a bad choice."
Researcher  2:48
"Yeah, I mean, like, if someone could choose, like, decide which we are experiencing a good choice or a bad choice for you. So that's just a portion to be the person to design?"
Child  3:03
Me
Researcher  3:05
All right. So is there any other person?
Child  3:10
No.
Researcher  3:10
"So you are the only person and kind of decide, okay, I want to do this. And I don't want to do this VR experiences or goods. So VRmakers. So when they have some, like, imagine there's a VR creator, they want to design some way or experience for you, or maybe for your families to think to have some important sensation should definitely keep in mind is it even more, so I don't have any stations for them."
Unknown Speaker  3:44
Not really.
Researcher  3:46
It's fine. So is there anything else you want to tell me?
Unknown Speaker  3:52
"No, no. Okay."
