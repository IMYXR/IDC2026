"So how often you practice here? Okay, so we will choose the education and the doctor scenario. Yep. So what did you think about the use of VR in these stories?"
Speaker 2  0:10
"I think it has the potential to be really beneficial. And I'm supportive of the uses that were just set were shown in the videos, what types of beneficial kayo? Like specifies? Yeah, I think, you know, in regards to education, I think it has the potential to make things so much more interesting and real for students and be a lot more engaging than the material that they're typically exposed to in like textbooks or whatnot. So if they're more engaged, and more likely to pay attention, they'll probably absorb more and remember more."

"So how about the house care? Yeah,"
Speaker 2  0:57
"I think that MRI example was a really great one where like, kids are often afraid of medical procedures, and you know, or like getting a shot or a vaccine or something. If you can distract them a little bit and take their mind off of it, then it's going to be, they're going to be a lot more compliant to get those things done."
Researcher  1:19
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So the next question, what kinds of issue or problems might we create for your child or for your family?"
Speaker 2  1:27
"Yeah, I mean, I think there's already so much technology in our lives. And they I've seen them be very addicted to use of phones and video games, and iPads, and YouTube and all the things. So just more, I'm a little bit hesitant to introduce more and more technology into their lives, because they do become so addicted"
Researcher  1:52
"to. So I remember, you mentioned you bought VR for your kids, right? So can you tell us the reason like why you choose to have a VR for"
Unknown Speaker  2:01
"my husband? Just to play games, and"
Researcher  2:05
"yeah, with your think like, you shouldn't be possible to allow your child to try it individually, or you think parents might be like, a company with with a child in VR,"
Speaker 2  2:17
"I don't think we further uses the things that we have on it, like there's no need for us to be there with them or observing what they're doing. I don't have any concerns with them using it other than like, just like physically what's around them and not breaking things? And the very last"
Researcher  2:36
"Yeah, okay. So that's why it would be a big question. So who should decide which we are experienced are suitable for two?"
Unknown Speaker  2:45
"Parents? Yeah,"
Researcher  2:47
"I mean, I keep the kingdom safe. Right? There any other stakeholder you can think of? teachers or school or like,"
Speaker 2  2:58
"Yeah, I mean, I certainly if they're going to be using them in school, I think the teachers need to be involved in in that decision as well. And making sure that it's appropriate for the classroom and not disruptive and all those things. So, you know, parents and then whichever stakeholders are involved in that setting, whether it be teachers or doctors or whatnot. Yeah."

"So when creator design we are for kids and families, what important thing should they keep in mind? Do you have any suggestions for this? We"
Unknown Speaker  3:27
are makers say it one more time.
Researcher  3:31
"When creator design we are for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind?"
Unknown Speaker  3:40
"When creating VR for kids,"
Researcher  3:42
"yeah. Like the content, or maybe the hardware design?"
Speaker 2  3:49
"Yeah. I mean, as far as content, I think it's similar to like considerations for video games and shows and just making sure it's age appropriate. I guess my a little bit of a concern would be like, we can't see what they're looking at unless it was like mirrored on your phone. So just making sure like, like I said, the content is appropriate. I think that's the biggest thing. I don't know how much of a risk there is for like, physical injury or like neck strain. If you're wearing this heavy thing on your head, how that affects like, your posture and your neck and things like that. That might be something to consider too."
Researcher  4:36
"That's a good point. Yeah. Is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for kids? Nope. Okay, thank you so much. Thanks."
