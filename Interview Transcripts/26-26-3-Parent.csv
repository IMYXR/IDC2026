I'm going to start by asking you what did you think about the use of VR in these stories and what parts of these stories stood out to you? I believe you watched them in the context of the doctor and at school. So I thought it was a really interesting concept. I can see it being very isolating and dangerous if it's used exclusively as an education tool or a distraction. But...

"If it's used in limited ways, I think it would be a great way to get kids more interactive and make certain medical procedures less scary. That's great. Yeah, I mean, just kind of following that thread, how can children and families use VR in more helpful, positive ways, in your opinion? I think limiting it so that it's not an escape. It's used for specific purposes."
01:00:00
"I think kids are naturally drawn towards wanting to do this and I see even with the iPads and the cell phones that the kids use that it's, it makes it harder to be social. It makes it harder to communicate in person with people."
01:19:00
"So kind of along these, like what kind of problems might be are creating for your children, or your grandchildren, or just in children and family in general? Well, specifically to the older one of the two here, she's got some special needs and I think that it opens up an avenue for bullying. It opens up... Making friends is already difficult. So if she's spending a lot of time in this sort of..."

"make believe environment, it makes it a lot more difficult to function in the real world."
01:57:00
"For the other one, I'm a little bit less concerned because she is naturally social on her own and involved in a lot of activities outside of using electronics. It's not as worrisome to me for her. But in general, I just feel like it needs to be carefully monitored. It needs to be used for specific purposes, especially if we're using it in an educational or medical setting."

It shouldn't be a substitute for having an actual classroom experience. Other than maybe in a situation like the pandemic where they couldn't have an actual classroom. Do you see that this could be a negative because... Because I think that you need to learn how to work with other humans in order to be successful in life. I don't think that it's something that... Everything can't be substituted into a home.

"When creators design VR for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind? Can you repeat that? First, who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? I mean, I think parents and educators or doctors should make that decision together. Doctors?"
03:15:00
"I mean depending on the setting that you're using it in, if you're using it in a medical setting, I think that the parents and the doctors should discuss whether that makes sense for this child. Parents know the kids the best. Doctors can present possible positive uses."
03:34:00
"So when creators design VR experiences for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind?"
03:50:00
"P:I think what the specific use is planned for and making sure that it's a part of the experience, not the entire experience. So like one of the scenarios I think they talked about, the kids did this little virtual field trip and then had a real in-person discussion afterwards. That would make sense to me. Making sure that there's interactive pieces to it that are actually expanding their understanding and knowledge of what they're doing."

R: Is there anything else you wanted to tell us about VR for kids and families that you thought of but didn't get the chance to speak about?
"P:No, I don't think so. It's a really interesting concept."
R:What about it?
"P:I just, I mean, being able to be in the middle of something that doesn't really exist is pretty cool."
"R: Oh, I see, I see, yeah, I thought that was pulling. Okay. Well, thank you so much for being part of this study and talking to us today."
