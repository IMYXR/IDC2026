"One of the school ones, not a fan of because kids are always on the screen anymore. And it just seems like a continuation of screen time and just their lack of focus."
00:43:00
"So thinking about the benefits, possible benefits of VR use, how can children use VR in positive or helpful ways?"
00:56:00
"At least for the school side of things, probably. Yeah, you have some classes."
01:05:00
"At least maybe on the history side of stuff, the subject matter of history, you can maybe go to that area or scene to re-enact it if it's possible. To get an idea of a real life experience. Yeah, because like some occasions you can't actually do that. I'm not sure if that's even possible. Yeah. So, you're like in my boat at the moment? Mm-hmm."
01:30:00
What kind of problems might VR create for your children or children's and families in general?
01:43:00
Should I be on it too much? Yeah.
01:55:00
How can being on it too much be problematic? Help me understand.
02:02:00
"Well, especially like without setting a time limit. Because he likes to be on a switch a little too much. So we've tried to set time limits and he doesn't like to obey by that. So I don't know if the virtual reality would have the same Has the same capability or capacity to Create a time limit. Like just shorten. What happens when you set a time limit? What happens?"
02:30:00
he doesn't obey what like if you... He still continues to play until we basically take it from him. When that happens that creates issues? He gets upset. Just like any other kid. So with virtual reality I don't know how that would really play. That's just a potential fear. Any other problems that you foresee from VR use for kids and family?
03:00:00
I don't know yet. Who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children? Or VR experiences are a good choice for children?
03:16:00
"I'd definitely say probably a combination of parents and even the child. And I'd say potentially teachers. Teachers? Okay. Because they'd be the more so to speak experts and as far as like a lesson plan, this is what we're doing, this is what you can use, or like a site or whatever they go to to bring up the subject matter. Oh that makes sense, okay."
03:46:00
other people or other organs that you think should be involved in making this decision?
03:56:00
"I'd rather have the government out of it. Okay. I mean I know they, you know, I'm sure the regulations are going to be put in place somehow or some way. But I'd rather have them not involve too much per say. When creating VR."
04:19:00
"creators of VR, design experiences for kids and family, what important things should they keep in mind?"
04:29:00
"Keep it simple. Keep it simple, okay. Don't make it too intrusive as far as complicated. Okay. Because not everybody's all tech savvy. Okay. So you used to be loose, okay? Yeah. When you say intrusive, what do you mean by intrusive? Just don't make it too complicated. Too complicated, okay. Because you get the grandparents, you know, it's today's generation. Not all of them have even access to computers. So sometimes with the tablet or virtual, I don't know."
04:59:00
"They might be intimidated by it. I see. OK, that makes a lot of sense. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell us about the VR for kids and family but you didn't get the chance to speak about or talk about today?"
05:18:00
"I'm not really sure, only because it was my first experience with it. So I don't really have pros and cons behind it, so to speak, since it was my first. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, it was a different experience, I'll say that. Yeah. In what ways was it different?"
05:40:00
just wearing the whole headset and having almost like a TV screen right in front of you.
05:52:00
"Okay. Sorry, that's all I got. No, it's fine. This is great. Thank you so much for your time."
