"We're gonna start this right here. So what did you think about the use of VR stories? I know you watch the ones at grad school and at the doctor, so what did you think of anything stand out to you?"
Speaker 2  0:13
"Em, it was cool and it helps kids like calm down... And like if there's scared of something, they can use it kind of as a distraction, or really to help them calm down."
Researcher  0:24
"Yeah, for sure. Are there any other benefits to VR that you see for kids or for families?"
Speaker 2  0:30
"Oh, it was a multiplayer, like you can see people like from other like that you wouldn't be able to see on a regular basis in your life, like maybe relatives that live far away. And it's really fun. And there are games that can like help, like, get your exercise like, I don't know if I have a VR but in our Nintendo Switch, like just dance, and like other games can help you get exercise with the VR. And it's fun."
Researcher  1:03
"Yeah, so it can be really helpful to do you see any problems that VR might create for you as a kid?"
Speaker 2  1:11
"Oh, I guess because the screen is really close to your eyes. It might hurt your eyes if you're on it too much. Anything else you can think of? Your eye doing a VR hands on because sometimes kids do it like too much and they don't want to stop playing it. Yeah. And then and Mike in the one story where he didn't want to do the exercises, and he played VR instead. I can guess isn't distracting from things you have to do?"
Researcher  1:42
For sure. What do you think should decide which VR experiences are good for children? Video?
Speaker 2  1:51
"People who know more about like how the mind works and how games will affect your mind. And like, lay like people who know about that stuff. Because then they can see. Like what might help kids like help them learn like problem solving, like a lot of games do. And like how to work together with other people like people you don't even know like online how to work together. Yeah. That's and they can see like, what games they think is good, because they know cuz like, doctors and like people who know about the brain, like know what games wouldn't be better? For?"
Researcher  2:35
Sure. So like doctors and professionals?
Speaker 2  2:42
"Yeah. And like, definitely not. There are a few games out here like, like the like for nap and stuff. And they're all kids who like that. And I don't know exactly. Play games, but I know a little bit about them. And maybe scary kids. And I don't know if it would help make them like less afraid of other things. Or if it was give them more like anxiety or something."
Researcher  3:13
"When the people who make these VR experiences or creating them, what do you think they should keep in mind?"
Speaker 2  3:25
"Who their audiences, like who their main target for that game is like, is it adults, children, everyone, they got to make sure the stuff in that game was like appropriate for the age group. Grading they're giving it?"
Researcher  3:44
"Yeah, for sure. And then finally, is there anything else you want to tell me about VR for families? Anything about your own experience in VR?"
Speaker 2  3:54
"Oh, it is cool school when we got to learn. Like we with a VR once we got to see like how different animals see. And like how some of them are more colorblind than others. Like echolocation and stuff, we got to see that using VR. We got to see their habitats. And that was really fun. So they can help you learn."
