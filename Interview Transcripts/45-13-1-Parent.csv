"Just for you. Okay, so what did you think about the use of VR in the stories? I noticed like you should ask health care, but most of the time, it was like, disagree about your resume,"

"I feel it's very socially isolating, I do not think it's going to be a good thing."

"So what if we have like, more advanced, maybe motion tracking happening, like so you can have some physical feedback, like for your remote to say,"
Speaker 2  0:31
"I still feel that kids are gonna miss out on social interaction, cooking with mom in the kitchen and making eye contact with their mom. Yeah, in front of their eyes and stupid I think you're learning your neural pathways socially interacting."
Researcher  0:50
"Yeah, that totally makes sense. So in the health care area is still have the same issue."
Speaker 2  0:56
"I mean, I understand like, you know, we're in the emergency room, I understand that we put a video on the front of the kids getting on video we do."

"Yeah, so they already have some other techniques can replace VR"
Yeah.
Gotcha. So what are some any other issues or problems you want to mention about using VR?
No.

Unknown Speaker  1:30
the parents

"parents? Okay, so can you give us some examples of like, how parents can you be more involved in this process?"
Speaker 2  1:39
"Okay. I don't know I guess he just every anybody who's you know, potentially, hey, here's your kid, you just have to you know, like, in a school situation, you know, I would never want to teachers free rein to make that decision. what was best for my kids. So, the doctor's office, I would need them to discuss with me if I wanted them to put on kids"
Researcher  2:10
"That make sense.  So if your child have the chance to try VR, do you think you will approve them to use it individually or like you want to account with them to use VR to gather"

Researcher  2:29
gotcha so next one when creator design we are for kids do how many sketches?
Speaker 2  2:38
"No, I don't think they need any suggestions. I think they're gonna make it so addicting that kids can't put it down."
Researcher  2:44
"Yeah, so they probably need to have some like screen time. Okay, gotcha. So is there anything else you want to tell me about VR? No. Okay, it's all good. Thank you so much."
