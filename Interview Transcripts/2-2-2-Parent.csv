"So what did you think about the use of VR in these stories? It was mostly good. The one where they could shift it to playing video games instead of doing the physical therapy is the only one I thought that was really not beneficial, you know, but it helped them focus from the pain but not rehab it either. But yeah, as far as the other ones for comfort factor for, well then it's nice to be able to get used to school in a different place by being there, by not being there kind of deals. "
00:22:00
"Yeah, there's some benefits. Is there certain parts of any of these stories besides the one that you mentioned that stood out to you? "
00:41:00
"Um, I don't know. I think it's cool that you're able to see the Smithsonian and stuff via virtual reality. In person there's nothing in place to be in person, but as far as good experience too, you know, and a good way of seeing it too. "
01:08:00
"So, just kind of following up on, how can children and family use VR in positive or helpful ways? "
"That I haven't really thought about family setting at all, besides a remote school like that. Yeah, like I said, there's nothing that can replace actually being in places, but it would be helpful to in limited quantities."
01:24:00
"Can you think of what kind of issues or problems might VR create for children? Maybe just becoming dependent on it would be one thing. So much of our lives are based around screens now that it would be not going outside, etc. stuff like that. That's a time and place. "
Can you think of a certain situation in which VR should not be used?
01:54:00
"It's something else. Don't replace it being outside unless you're physically unable and stuff like that. You know, heights in the woods and stuff like that. So, sitting on a couch doing it or whatever, physically doing it. There's no replacement for that. So you think that, okay, yeah, so you're saying like, not going on a VR hike, but actually doing it. Yeah, something like that. There's things you gotta actually do."
02:18:00
"Who do you think should decide which experiences are suitable for kids? Parents would be a big one Educators, just private schools too"
02:29:00
"These are the two main people, okay? Yeah.When creators design VR for kids and families, what important things should they keep in mind?"
02:35:00
" Just the dependency on it, once again. Yeah, that would be the big thing, I think. Can you think of specific examples of these considerations? You said dependencies or other stuff that we should consider? We try to limit screen time with my son, you know, so it's just kind of..."

The Collinger is worth it more or less. It's not on all the time. And other distractions with phones and iPads.
03:10:00
"Is there other concerns that you might have from this use? No, no. Is there anything else that you want to tell us about the VR? No, this is my first experience with it really, so it's cool to see it. That is great, okay. Awesome, well thank you so much. Yep, no problem."
