"Okay, so now we're going to give you a chance to talk about what you said. So you choose healthcare and education. Okay, so what did you think about the use of AI in the store?"
Speaker 1  6:02
"I thought it was very useful, especially for like, exam settings like MRIs and stuff like that. So kids can be really nervous. And I think it would help. I think there is. With the second story with the child who was using VR after the accident, I think there is a danger that they don't get the physical therapy that they need, and that they get too focused on the VR. But I think it can also be useful as long as it's sort of regulated, like, you can do this for an hour, or something like that."
Researcher  6:37
Yeah. How about the educational story?
Speaker 1  6:41
"I thought it was, I thought the it's a good idea. Especially like, if you're trying to do an educational type of field trip, and you can't go to places, or if a child has to travel a really long way. Like if they're if they live really far away. But I think there is a lack of social contact, maybe that's missing if the whole school is just VR. I think that would be the dichotomy."
Researcher  7:11
Lack of the real connection.
Child  7:11
"Yeah, I think that would be the main issue."
Researcher  7:16
"What's kind of your dimensions? Like, are there any other issues or problems might VR create for your child or for your family?"
Speaker 2  7:25
"Yeah, I think mostly just getting too immersed in the world and not really focusing on the outside. So as long as like video games in general, they can be entertaining and useful. But as long as it's not like a whole day, or something like that,"
Researcher  7:42
yeah. So who should decide which VR experiences are suitable for children?
Speaker 1  7:49
So I think probably the parents
Researcher  7:51
"know, to say that was screentime."
Unknown Speaker  7:54
"Yeah, I think so."
Researcher  7:57
Are there any other stakeholder you can think of?
Speaker 2  8:03
"I mean, I guess teachers too just I don't know, I don't think like politics should really get into it too much. I think it's difficult. Yeah. I don't know."
Researcher  8:18
"Yeah, it's okay. Yeah. So when creators design we are for hidden bandits. What important thing should they keep in mind? Do you have any suggestions for those VR creators."
Speaker 1  8:33
"Just keeping an appropriate I guess,"
Researcher  8:36
"and making it like more attractive. Okay, about probably like that automatic usually."
Speaker 1  8:42
"Right. So, yeah. I mean, yeah, I think those are the main things. I mean, if we wanted to be attractive, right, so that it's distracting. But yeah,"
Researcher  8:55
it seems like the carriers want to constrain the time you did a smartphone pocket is the same story.
Speaker 1  9:04
Yes.
Researcher  9:06
Is there anything else you want to tell me for VR for families?
Speaker 1  9:12
"No, I think that's about it."
Researcher  9:14
Thank you so much.
